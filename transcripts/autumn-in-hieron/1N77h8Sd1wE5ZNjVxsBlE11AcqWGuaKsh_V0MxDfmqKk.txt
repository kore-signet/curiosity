Autumn in Hieron 27: The Shores of Ordenna
Transcriber: the dread biter#0090

AUSTIN: The crowd begins to disperse. They don’t get to be here for the final judgement. They’ve said their due, and now it’s time for the Just Record. Doce stays, obviously—that’s kind of his job here, is to enter this into the records of Nacre—and looks up at Queen Adelaide Triste, who smiles at Hella and nods her head. And the pillar begins to drop, and you’re free to go.

[MUSIC - “EVE’S LIGHT PARADE” begins]

AUSTIN: She then turns her eyes to Lem and sighs.

	AUSTIN (as Adelaide): We have a complicated relationship... to... the events of today.

AUSTIN: —she says.

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): Sometimes what we hold in our hearts goes against the duties we must perform. I know that better than you could ever understand. We know that better than you could ever understand. ...It seems that you, however... you’re... almost proud to flaunt... your loyalty to your friend... in our court. It pains me to free one of you and imprison another, but here we are.

JACK: [laughs] Oh, dang.

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): You will, from this moment forward, be attached to our coterie, and as we leave... our humble city, you will remain an attendant... to our moving library. Where you will serve, under Doce, until you’ve worked off... your sin.

[MUSIC ends]

AUSTIN: She nods and a few guards begin to move towards Lem.

JACK: I mean. [sighs] There’s nothing I can do about this.

AUSTIN: Not really.

JACK: Gonna just have to—gonna have to rely on my friends who I’ve treated so well.

[AUSTIN laughs]

ALI: Mm.

JACK: To help me out.

AUSTIN: All right. They—with no objections, or no intervening, uh...

JACK (as Lem): Uh. Mm, no, just j—mm—

KEITH: [jokingly] Hold, mm—

ALI: [jokingly] Eh—

JACK (as Lem): Hang on. Wait a second.

KEITH: [jokingly] Hm! Uh!

[ALI laughs]

KEITH (as Fero): Your high—uh, your highness.

JACK (as Lem): Okay, I have some questions first, very quickly. Um, do I still get to keep my violin?

AUSTIN: Your what?

JACK: My violin.

AUSTIN: Um. You’re asking this to her. Or are you asking me?

JACK: Please.

AUSTIN: Okay. Um. She nods.

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): I would never take the—we would never—we would never... A tool of such magnificence—

[ALI scoffs and laughs]

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): —in the hands of one accomplished. It would seem foolish for us to... deny Nacre that beauty.

JACK: I think—

KEITH (as Fero): Can—

JACK: —all they’ve done is just acquired themselves a very effective library system. That seems that that’s all they’re interested in. Uh. [snorts] I can’t do anything about it.

KEITH (as Fero): Can—uh—your highness, can I say something real quick?

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): Yes, boy?

KEITH (as Fero): Um. I’m kinda old, but.

[ALI laughs]

KEITH (as Fero): Ehh. Anyway. [laughs] Not old-old, but like not a boy. Anyway. Uh... If—Hella’s found innocent, and she’s gonna help us with whole invasion situation, wouldn’t it be best—wouldn’t it be nice—wouldn’t it be...

JACK: The best and nice. Uh, good times.

KEITH (as Fero): Wouldn’t it be just to allow Lem to assist in the same way. Obviously you know about how skilled he is with his violin.

	AUSTIN (as Adelaide): [sighs] There is—

	KEITH (as Fero): Surely you can’t—surely you couldn’t want one less person helping.

	AUSTIN (as Adelaide): Oh, little bird, you do not understand, even after all of this.

	KEITH (as Fero): I think I understand pretty good—

	AUSTIN (as Adelaide): We don’t—

KEITH (as Fero): —but like, come on!

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): [sighs] There will be no defense.

KEITH (as Fero): Yeahhhhh, but like... come on...

ALI: Is she saying that in front of the crowd? Wait—

AUSTIN: No. The crowd’s gone. The crowd dispersed.

ALI: Okay.

AUSTIN: I—I—

KEITH: Only Ventaro’s there.

AUSTIN: Only Ventaro is here at this point. Um.

KEITH: Ventaro and the gua—how many guards?

AUSTIN: A handful of like her super-elites. You know?

ALI: Okay.

KEITH: So they’re pretty beefy.

AUSTIN: Yeah, they’re—they’re beefy.

ALI: Mm. [laughs]

AUSTIN: Yes. Yes.

KEITH: And I... probably don’t have my weapon.

AUSTIN: [amused] No, you do not have your weapon here.

KEITH: I didn’t—I didn’t come to this armed?

AUSTIN: No! 

KEITH: To the teeth?

AUSTIN: You did not!

[ALI laughs]

AUSTIN: Um.

ALI (as Hella): Can I get my sword back?

KEITH (as Fero): Oh, can Hella get her sword back?

ALI (as Hella): Yeah.

KEITH: That’s in character.

AUSTIN: She—her eyes dance up to... a window behind Hella, that had—the curtains had been drawn on for a while. She nods to Ventaro, who moves over and opens it up, and you can see against the—against the sunset a line that is literally cutting the sun in two in the sky. It’s a black line, rising up out of the palace. She nods and says,

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): It’s done its job. They see where we are now. They’ll be here soon. You can have your blade, Veral.

KEITH (as Fero): Uh... Queenie. How do you expect to keep these people from mounting a defense on their own?

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): It doesn’t matter.

KEITH (as Fero): I—well, I mean it matters like a little bit.

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): No.

KEITH (as Fero): Doesn’t it need to like at least look like you’re trying?

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): We have enough force to last the day that matters. Our plans are already put into action. Little bird, it is time for you to fly home.

KEITH (as Fero): We—uh—like back to the ca—back to like the jail place? Where’s home? Where’s my home?

ALI (as Hella): Wait—why are you doing this to us? And by us I mean Ordenna, that—should be clear. [laughs]

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): [sighs repeatedly]

KEITH (as Fero): Oh, I got this one! Uh, they’re still mad that they can’t—they’re mad that they can’t be—

ALI (as Hella): I’m asking her.

KEITH (as Fero): —tourists because if they stub their toe, everyone will think that they’re weirdos.

AUSTIN: She shakes her head.

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): Little bird, it is like you’ve never wanted anything for someone else. It’s like you’ve never understood that sometimes those you love don’t know what’s best for them. It’s a hard lesson to learn. It’s one my brother never learned. At least as far as I know. 

The world will be a better place when this is done. It will be a new place, a different place, and that is scary. We understand that. It will be a place without death as we know it, it will be a place where, like here, death is an option we take... Why not?

KEITH (as Fero): Because—you can’t just—

ALI (as Hella): No one wants that!

KEITH (as Fero): —you can’t just force it—that on people!

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): [forcefully] You don’t understand.

KEITH (as Fero): In the same way that you want death to be a choice, immortality also has to be a choice! You can’t just force an entire—world of people—to—

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): You don’t think that Tristero forced his will first?

KEITH (as Fero): Well, of course he did. He was a dickhead, also!

ALI (as Hella): Yeah.

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): So which is it you would prefer? The world that—my ancestor created?

AUSTIN: And she uses ‘my’ here.

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): Where he invented death? Where he could end life at his will? That world? Because there’s nothing natural about that world either. You think that death should happen, because you’ve lived with it your whole life, boy. But I’ve seen that that is not necessarily the case, and it was at one point—deep, deep, long ago—not the case anywhere.

AUSTIN: She sighs.

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): Before Tristero there was no death—ever. And then he took it as his project. He took it for—his game. To push things here and there. And he had his rivals. And he let them live. And then things changed, and there was death as we know it. And I think there can be a different way. A third way. A way where there is still death, but not—not on some god’s whim. Not on—the air of a breeze. Not on the blade of a madman. Death will be a choice, still. For everyone. 

I’m done here. [bleakly amused] And it is too late, regardless. 

Lem, return to the library. You will be provided for until the caravan moves out.

KEITH (as Fero): [pouty] [sighs] You sure he can’t come with us? C’mon.

AUSTIN: She doesn’t even give you a response.

[ALI snorts, KEITH laughs]

AUSTIN: The column she is on lifts into the air higher, and the roof above it opens, and she is gone.

KEITH: I make a—I make a motion to Fero, and I’m—I like point at him, then back at me, and then—

AUSTIN: To—to Lem? [laughing loudly]

ALI: You did it!

KEITH: —him and back to me like a—

AUSTIN: You did it!

JACK: You just Fero’d yourself!AUSTIN: You Fero’d yourself!

KEITH: Shit. Fuck. Lem.

AUSTIN: Ah. It happens. 

KEITH: What?

AUSTIN: It happens.

KEITH: I look at Lem, back and forth, fingers back and forth, and then a wink.

ALI: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Okay.

KEITH: And then a thumbs up.

AUSTIN: Um. How are we doing?

JACK: Great.

AUSTIN: How are people doing on time? How do they feel?KEITH: I’m doing well. How are you doing?

ALI: I’m doing fine.

AUSTIN: I think we’re really close. To—

JACK: To the end of the sessions? Or, like—

AUSTIN: To the end of—yes, to the end of the session. If we keep—

JACK: Yeah, I’d be happy to keep going.

AUSTIN: Okay.

JACK: Mhm. Totally.

AUSTIN: You’re basically told you have until the morning to leave, and you should leave even sooner than that. That is to Hella and—and Fero.

KEITH: Mhm.

AUSTIN: Ventaro tells Hella that she should head to the palace to retrieve her sword.

KEITH: Um. Yo, we gotta like—

ALI: Yeah.

KEITH: —do something about this—we can’t just go home, right? 

ALI: Mhm.

KEITH: Like that’s not even an option?

ALI: Well, I mean…

AUSTIN: L—

KEITH: Well, I mean, it is an option. We could just leave.

ALI: No. I mean, we’re gonna go… okay. So, we go to the palace.

KEITH: Mhm.

AUSTIN: Fero is not admitted.

ALI: Okay.

AUSTIN: Uh, Lem, by the way, you are back—

KEITH: Why not? I make a whole froll: Fuss about it!

AUSTIN: —okay. Lem, you’re—you are back in the library, in the same—

JACK: Under the library.

AUSTIN: —the same like set of floors that you were—that you were given access to before, plus an additional—like a little—a little um. Kind of like a little librarian’s quarters, like a researcher’s cell, basically—

JACK: Hm!

AUSTIN: —with like a little cot in the corner. And, uh. And, um. Some food and stuff.

JACK: Aw, man.

AUSTIN: Uh.

ALI: Ah—well—

AUSTIN: Ventaro tells you that it’s probably in your best interests to just stay here while the invasion happens? Um. That they will never come in here, they will never find this little cell in the little corner of the little library. Or the massive library, I guess. It’s—it’s just safer for you here.

JACK: It—by my terms, it is a little library.

AUSTIN: Right. Right.

[ALI laughs]

AUSTIN: Um. And that—and that there is an escape plan for you and him and the queen and their entourage that he’ll inform you about as soon as—like as soon as it’s ready to go.

JACK: Aw, man. Right. Okay. I think that it is probably in my best—like—the last time we split up in Nacre…

AUSTIN: [mildly] Mhm!

[ALI laughs]

AUSTIN: [mildly] Yeah!

JACK: ...we donked it. So I think I am going to trust…

KEITH: Yes—yes—yes, we donked it.

ALI: [laughs] W—s—Mm. So—but—Keith—

JACK: ...you know, me and my overwhelming sense of curiousity.

KEITH: Yes.

ALI: W—two-prong here.

KEITH: Mhm.

ALI: Save Lem. [unsure] Kill the Queen?

KEITH: Yeah.

[JACK laughs]

ALI: Okay. Okay. Um… how?

KEITH: Uh. With sneaking—

ALI: Yeah. Okay.

KEITH: —and with weapons.

ALI: I am in the p—no. That’s a bad idea.

AUSTIN: Oops, that’s the wrong place.

ALI: Um.

KEITH: What is—what sort of—uh, as a panther, Austin—

AUSTIN: Uh-huh.

KEITH: What sort of agency do I have as one of the… birds?

[JACK laughs]

KEITH: Uh, w—‘cause the panther—

AUSTIN: Yeah.

KEITH: —can turn into a swarm—

ALI: I’m not gonna mention...

KEITH: —of smaller—how much agency does—like I don’t have like—

AUSTIN: No, they can’t split up like—

KEITH: I’m assuming they can’t—

AUSTIN: —they can’t like go to different places.
ALI: They move in like a…

KEITH: Yeah.

AUSTIN: There’s—they move in like a swarm. Um. And they have like limited—like they can do it like within like a city block, let’s say, but not like…

KEITH: Okay.

AUSTIN: They can’t like go across town, or they can’t like… Um. You know.

KEITH: Mhm.

AUSTIN: It might even just be like eyesight. It might be—it might be like—until you can’t—they can’t see… the rest of them.

KEITH: Right.

AUSTIN: You know?
KEITH: Yeah.

AUSTIN: In fact, what if it’s—literally—at that—at that moment—

KEITH: That’s pretty far. I agree with that.

AUSTIN: —they become… 

KEITH: Yeah.

AUSTIN: ...they like stop being part of the unit. And they just become a little black bird.

KEITH: Right.

ALI: Aw.

KEITH: Okay. Aw.

AUSTIN: And that’s how blackbirds were invented.

ALI: Wait, but—

[ALI and JACK laugh]

AUSTIN: They were all panthers once.

KEITH: Yeah. Nailed it. Every blackbird was an exploratory little panther bird.

AUSTIN: Yep.
ALI: Um.

[15:02]
JACK: Every time you say you don’t believe—

KEITH: They were the Lem.

AUSTIN: [laughs] Yeah. Yeah.

JACK: [scoffs] Aw. 

ALI: Aw.

JACK: Aw... ...I’m stuck in the library!

ALI: Okay. Don’t worry—

JACK: I thought libraries was gonna be fun.

ALI: We’ll get you outta there. Um.

KEITH: Although in some way, Lem has basically everything that he wanted three sessionsseconds ago.

JACK: Yeah. Well!

KEITH: Maybe don’t even fuckin help Lem.

JACK: Yeah, but.

ALI: Well.

KEITH: [frustrated] But I can’t hold that against him ‘cause I don’t know about it!

[JACK and ALI laugh]

KEITH: [angry noise]

AUSTIN: So.

JACK: So. I think the fact that he has been imprisoned is different to him saying—to a man saying “If you do this, you’ll never leave Nacre” and him going “Okay!” 

AUSTIN: Yeah!

JACK: —is different to—

KEITH: Mm.

JACK: “We’re just locking you in this caravan now.”

ALI and KEITH: Yeah.

KEITH: Not—don’t wanna ring your bell now, do you?

JACK: My library bell, ugh.

ALI: [laughs] Um. Okay. Plans.

KEITH: Um.

AUSTIN: And the clock is ticking, in a sense.

KEITH and ALI: Yeah.

KEITH: What is the—what is—what is the hour of the day?

AUSTIN: I think it’s—it’s l—it’s—

JACK: [laughs] How wet is the wheel?

AUSTIN: It’s pretty wet. It’s like—it’s like—

KEITH: [laugh] Ugh, what a good expression. How wet is the wheel.

AUSTIN: It’s more than damp, less than soaked. Right?

KEITH: Okay. Um.

ALI: Oh, my god…

AUSTIN: It’s not—it’s—

[KEITH and ALI laugh]

JACK: How did it take people so long to invent the concept of time when we did it in an evening?

[KEITH, AUSTIN, ALI laugh]

AUSTIN: Um. It’s… around the time it is now for us, playing the game. In the east coast of north america.

KEITH: Right.

ALI: OkayAli.

KEITH: Okay. So eight thirty pm… wet.

AUSTIN: [laughing] Yeah. Yeah. It’s—that’s how wet the wheel is.

[ALI laughs]

KEITH: How wet is the wheel? Oh, it’s about eight thirty one pm wet.

AUSTIN: About eight thirty yeah, wet, yeah.

KEITH: Um. The...that’s one thing about Hieron is that all of them—

AUSTIN: [loudly] Eight thirty pm, pretty moist.

[Laughter]

ALI: Oh my god...

JACK: Nailed it.

KEITH: People—people in Nacre, one of their skills is being able to tell exactly how wet something the wheel is... [trails off in laughter]

[ALI laughs]

JACK: [mumbling] They’re a coastal nation…

KEITH: Um. 

AUSTIN: Yeah!

KEITH: Mhm.

JACK: Questions~?

KEITH: Um.

[ALI laughs quietly]

KEITH: I think that we—Lem’s not like locked up though? He’s not like locked in there? Did I miss—

ALI: Well, he’s in a giant library.

AUSTIN: He has—yeah, he can move around in those floors and all that.

JACK: I think it’s like house arrest, right?

AUSTIN: It’s like house arrest, yeah. Exactly. There are guards positioned at the entryways, you know?

KEITH: Entr—And so—

JACK: Famously easy-to-break-out-of house arrest.

ALI: Can he be like hanging out around windows so we can find him?

AUSTIN: Sure.

JACK: Yeah, but you need to communicate that to me somehow.

AUSTIN: Yeah. Yeah.

ALI: Yeah…

AUSTIN: You know?

JACK: Like—

KEITH: Should we wait—oh. Okay. Hella. Should we wait for the invasion to start? Before dr—pulling any moves?

ALI: ...N—yeah, I mean…

KEITH: Because as they st—as soon as it starts, right? Like…

JACK: [sneezes] Sorry.

KEITH: People will be distracted—bless you—people will be distracted, uh like the—I guess—I guess the main one is people will be distracted, and then if we can take down the queen…

ALI: Yeah.

KEITH: Then people can—will start dying.

ALI: ‘Cause I think Hella  is secretly like… What I want to take care of—

KEITH: I guess the—the—

ALI: —I want to do before they get here, ‘cause I’m really worried about this, but also like she understands that there’s like a—a tactical advantage there.

KEITH: The good—the good alignment version of this is ki—like once the queen is dead, then the—we can be like, “H—don’t—no invasion can—then everyone can live!” Like that’s—I don’t think there’s a way to do that.

ALI: Um. That.

AUSTIN: That’s—

ALI: Austin.

AUSTIN: Yeah?

ALI: Can I—while I’m in that palace like picking up my sword or whatever, can I—um—it would be some sort of roll, but like could I just sort of loiter a little bit to kind of figure out what the plan—her escape plan is?

AUSTIN: [doubtful] Mm. I—she was pretty direct about her escape plan. Her escape plan was like, they’re leaving.

ALI: Well, no, to—but to Lem she—well like to—that—she’s leaving like --

AUSTIN: No, she said that to everybody… what—what she said to—uh like once the invasion hits—

KEITH: To the three of us plus like Ventaro and the guards.

AUSTIN: Yeah. Like—she—once the—

JACK: Oh.

ALI: No no, but like what I’m saying—

JACK: I can help here.

ALI: —is that like if Le—if Hella hears a guard being like “Yeah, the carriage—

AUSTIN: Mhm.

ALI: “—is behind this door to the left,” Hella could be there!

AUSTIN: Right right, see what you’re saying. Um.

JACK: Like... I could theoretically help out here. If we have some sort of carrier pigeon in the library, I’m sure that’s something relevant to the libary, I can at least try and find it.

AUSTIN: No, becuase—because what she’s looking for is like a specific like—what hour of the day are we leaving. Not like—

ALI: Yeah.

AUSTIN: There’s no like History of Escape Plan book. Do you know what I mean? Like… this is a—this is a—

JACK: Mm, yeah. 

KEITH: History... [laughing] 

JACK: There would be in my library, back home.

AUSTIN: Right, right! This is—this bit hadn’t been added to the library yet, or to the—to that book yet. You know, like.

KEITH: Um. Speaking of carrier pigeons, could I be a mouse in Hella’s pocket?

AUSTIN: Sure. That you can totally do.

KEITH: And go in the palace?

ALI: Oh yeah, sure. Aw.

KEITH: Okay.

ALI: Hey, buddy.

AUSTIN: Uh give me a roll on that, so we know—plus—your—

[Mouse squeaking sound effect plays]

ALI: Um. What am I rolling?

AUSTIN: No, not you, not you.

ALI: Oh.

KEITH: Yeah. I would be rolling, uh—I would be rolling Wisdom for the—for transformation? To get the hold?AUSTIN: Right. Yes.

KEITH: Um. Oh! 

AUSTIN: Yes.

KEITH: And we also learned that this—we’d been doing this shit wrong.

AUSTIN: Yep!

ALI: We can do this forever.

KEITH: Uh, so, that’s an 8, which means I get I think two hold?

AUSTIN: It does mean you get… t—two… Mm. That sounds right.

KEITH: Or is it one?

AUSTIN: You don’t have these written down. Why don’t you have these written down?

KEITH: I do have them it—see—look in my—

AUSTIN: I don’t see them in your th—or—oh, I’m looking at Lem, god damn it. [laughs]

[Laughter]

AUSTIN: I swear to christ, me.

KEITH: Um.

AUSTIN: No, you also don’t have it written down. Okay, good.

KEITH: I’ve got no idea—I also got it written down, that’s so weird!

AUSTIN: It’s weird.

KEITH: I believe that it is three, two, and one.

AUSTIN: I’m pretty sure that’s right, but I also have the book right here, so… I’m gonna flip through it…

KEITH: Okay, yeah. Because there’s no—there’s no “Oh, you failed to transform.” Like that’s not—

AUSTIN: Well, no, failing a roll is still failing a roll. Um. Which I can do whatever the fuck you w—whatever I want.

KEITH: Um. Right, yeah, sure. Yeah. Um.

AUSTIN: I—I don’t think that you’ll do that, but—oh yeah yeah yeah here we go. Um. Oh no, you’re right, you’re right.

KEITH: I mean, I already rolled, and I did not—yeah, three, two, one.

AUSTIN: It is three, two, one. Yeah. You’re right.

KEITH: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Um, so what’d you get?

KEITH: I got an 8.

AUSTIN: Oh, okay. So you get two.

KEITH: So I have two.

AUSTIN: Um. And then yeah you—you—

KEITH: And what that means now, instead of the way that we were doing it was I have as many—I can—I have as many moves as I want as a mouse. But it—but our moves are—I like—the mouse-specific moves—

AUSTIN: Right.

KEITH: —I have two of. Uh, which I doubt there’ll be many mouse-specific moves.

AUSTIN: Uh, but like there—there can be.

JACK: Cheese?

KEITH: I guess like maybe I get—maybe I’m better at sneaking and stuff.

AUSTIN: Yeah, I think any sort of like sneaky thing.

KEITH: Like that’s…

AUSTIN: Any sort of like sneaky thing—

KEITH: Yeah.

AUSTIN: —or like trying to find like a hole through a place to get into a different place, um.

[JACK laughs]

AUSTIN: You know what I mean?

JACK: They say [???]

KEITH: Oh, yeah! Maybe I can roll for a hidden passage.

AUSTIN: Yeah. Hidden passage type stuff would totally work. And also some stuff will just be fictionally harder, like you can’t…

KEITH: Yeah yeah yeah, I can’t—I’m not gonna attack someone as a mouse.

AUSTIN: Right. Exactly. Um.

KEITH: But I can transform from a mouse to a dangerous thing, probably when I’m not in your pocket anymore.

AUSTIN: Ideally!

[ALI laughs, JACK chuckles]

AUSTIN: All right. Um. So yeah, so let’s do Hella and Fero in the palace. One of the guards begins to escort to—you know, up a series of staircases. Some through like back passages, and some that are like the most obvious spiral staircases you’ve ever seen, it’s just really ostentatious. And...

KEITH: Mhm. [mock-serious] Oh, this is obviously a spiral staircase.

[ALI laughs]

AUSTIN: Yeah. Yeah. Wow, what a—

KEITH: This is very clearly not a straight-step—

AUSTIN: Unbelievable. And leads you to the top floor of the palace. It is—it is a long walk, but you know you’re Hella. You can climbd stairs, you know how stairs.

KEITH and ALI: Mhm.

KEITH: Yeah.

AUSTIN: And when you…

KEITH: How many guards?AUSTIN: Uh, just—there’s just—this is just the one. Who’s here.

KEITH: Okay.

ALI: Oh, okay.

AUSTIN: And when you reach the top floor, there at the scene that I described to you last time, is Empress Adelaide. She’s sitting at her desk, looking over papers. Not in full regalia, like kind of in relaxing—or kind of like relaxed clothing, but still, you know, still buttoned up. But—but—I think like s—I’m picturing kind of a shirt with a high collar and buttons that go like diagonally down the collar and then across her chest.

KEITH: Mhm.

AUSTIN: In a kind of a white and silver? Color scheme? And then—and then I think she has like pants on, here. She has just like—

KEITH: Yeah.

AUSTIN: —black pants on. And the sword is in this big hallway, or—so she’s in like a big open hall, where her—it’s where her desk is, and her desk is facing Nacre and the sea. Out—and outside—windows, there’s a balcony. That’s where—that is where, last time, Fero landed as a bird and she made eye contact with him. There are also up on this floor like—her bedroom is over there, and then she has her own private library over there. But then behind her is where the… the sword is. Inside of a… a kind of mount, that has—that looks like the symbol of the Disciples of Fantasmo, which is that kind of like three vertical parallel lines at different heights, descending from like tall to medium to short, but the sword is the tall one.

JACK: Mm.

KEITH: Do you—you wanna know what’s fucked up? Is that like Hella just went through this whole trial—

AUSTIN: Mhm.
KEITH: —and she killed Calhoun, and everybody in the whole fucking town is like bummed out of it—

AUSTIN: Yep.

KEITH: —and they set her free, and now we wanna kill the other one! I feel like kinda bad about it—

ALI: It’s fine. It’s fine—the—mm.

KEITH: —but like it’s not—[laughing] I feel so bad about it!

ALI: I—Adelaide is like my favorite character in this game, but, um.

[???]: Mhm.

ALI: Thing’s gotta be done. Um.

AUSTIN: She, um. She signs a—she signs something and looks up as you come in, and she says, ah,

	AUSTIN (as Adelaide): Little bird. Out.

KEITH: I crawl up onto Hella’s shoulder. As a mouse still.

ALI: [uncomfortable] Mm. [laughs]

	AUSTIN (as Adelaide): Mm. My Ordennan sister.

AUSTIN: —she says.

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): Take the sword.

KEITH: Just gag a little.

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): Take the sword. Leave.

AUSTIN: She smiles. And like nods backwards to where it is.

ALI: Mm. Um. I th—Hella walks over to it, but she sort of notices the symbol?

AUSTIN: Yeah.

ALI: And then before taking it, um. 

ALI (as Hella): Wait—what do you know about this?

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): I have learned a lot from Ventaro. He is a... a wise man who has studied these things. It is a... a weapon forged by... a number of men and women who... who thought that they could change the word—the world with their... with their magic, who thought that they could single-handedly stop an event larger than history itself. And when they couldn’t, when they failed to do that, their punishment was to be forged themselves into a weapon.

KEITH: Uh, I wanna transform into... a person.

AUSTIN: Okay, sure. You’re a person.

KEITH: And. And ask what the event was? And then I also want to position myself sort of as a triangle between—like a three point triangle, with the queen, Hella, and myself.

AUSTIN: Mhm. Um. So Hella is near the sword, you are kind of—you are diagonal between—yeah yeah I see what you’re saying.

KEITH: Yeah. However far they are away from each other, equal distance from each other...

AUSTIN: Yep. Equilateral triangle.

KEITH: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Okay.

KEITH: Yes, an equilateral, but no isoscelesisoceles here, thank you!

[JACK and AUSTIN laugh]

AUSTIN: Okay. Um. She says,

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): The same event that Tristero gave up his godhood for. We did not see what happened to the world out there. And I’ve only... read things here and there, heard stories from those who—come here. Over the years.

AUSTIN: She is also, again, speaking in first person here like purposefully. This isn’t me slipping up. Um. This is like the most buttoned-down you’ve seen—you’ve seen her.

KEITH: Mhm.

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): It was... It was the sort of thing... Events like that don’t happen anymore. Because the beings who could—the beings—the beings that could invoke that much force and that much power, the beings for whom the world was like language, they killed themselves off. All of them, in their own foolish ways. And this thing, this trinket, this blade is just another… remnant of that time. When everything seemed to be in flux. At least, that’s what I understand.

[Extended pause]

KEITH: Uh, Ali.

ALI: Yeah.

KEITH: Are we—are—how are we gonna do this?

ALI: S—So—Hella takes the sword off the wall.

KEITH: Okay.

AUSTIN: Your hand stings when you touch it.

ALI: Mm.

JACK: I think you’re making a mistake. [whispers] I think you’re making a mistake.

AUSTIN (as the sword): Angelo. Angelo! Angelo!

AUSTIN: —it begins to sing.

ALI: Mm. Yeah, this is gonna be hard for Hella to do this now. Um, I think—oh, god.

KEITH: D—uh.

ALI: Shh—

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): Sheathe—sheathe the blade.

AUSTIN: —says Adelaide.

ALI: [laughs] Hella’s noticeably freaked out, but she kind of… she grips it tighter, and then she looks to Fero?

KEITH: I walk towards Adelaide, and I hold out my hand, and I just wanna—I say—

KEITH (as Fero): Thank you for not killing Lem. For.

JACK: [laughs] Gee, thanks!

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): [sighs] You know my thoughts on death, little bird. It’s—

	KEITH (as Fero): I guess I do.

KEITH: Does she shake my hand?

AUSTIN: Oh, I thought you were like holding it up, I didn’t know that you were—

KEITH: No no no, I was—I was approaching her and I’m gonna...

AUSTIN: No, she isn’t—she is like literally still doing paperwork as you—as you’re talking to her. Like she hasn’t made eye contact with any of you. She’s looking down at her desk. Her back is to you. Um.

KEITH: Okay. She’s not gonna—? Okay.

[30:15]

AUSTIN: [sighs] She says—

KEITH: Th—

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): You know my thoughts on death. It is a thing that should be entered into by one’s own volition. [almost amused] It is so great a choice, that to—that to take it from someone else... [seriously] is, maybe, the only real sin.

KEITH (as Fero): But it’s fine to torture them until they submit.

ALI: [sighs]

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): I’ve never done that.

KEITH (as Fero): No? 

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): No.

KEITH (as Fero): You would have.

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): I didn’t have to. And now I never have to, thanks to... our Ordennan friend.

ALI (as Hella): [correcting] To your father.

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): [sighs] Thanks to a lot of things. I had no idea he was still alive. I had [slight laugh] no idea. And now my brother is, too, and... what a freeing thing that is to know. Now [laughs]... Now that I know the chain is unbroken, I have no worries!

AUSTIN: She stands, finally, and turns.

ALI: I... so... whe—mm.

[JACK laughs]

ALI: So when Fero looked—when Hella looked at Fero before, she was looking for like an okay?

AUSTIN: Uh-huh.

ALI: And I think she still kind of is?

JACK: I cannot believe you’re about to murder another person!

ALI: [with a laugh] Fero, do you nod?

KEITH: Uh, I don’t nod. I transform into a bear.

JACK: Oh, no.

ALI: Mm.

AUSTIN: Go ahead! Give me that roll.

KEITH: All right. Roll plus Wis.

ALI: I’m gonna keep moving my hands, ‘cause I can’t…

AUSTIN: Nice!

KEITH: 10.

AUSTIN: Take two.

JACK: ...while I’m in the library.

AUSTIN: This is, uh—this is good.

KEITH: Take three.

AUSTIN: Um.

ALI: [laughs] I feel so bad.

[JACK laughs]

AUSTIN: You can feel as the blade—back in the library, you feel a—just a brief shake—

JACK: Mhm.

AUSTIN: —when the blade is drawn from the, uh—from the stand that it was in. All through the city, it shakes for just a moment. And the light changes, just so. Soon—

KEITH: Do you think the people in the town think that it’s the invasion?

AUSTIN: Who knows. Maybe. Maybe. Um. Ventaro comes to you, at that moment. And he has a little box with him. It has the symbol of the Disciples of Fantasmo on it. The three, uh—the three vertical lines. Um. Again, that’s what—that’s what we the players know is the name of that symbol.

JACK: Yeah. Right.

AUSTIN: That is not what Ventaro has called it, that is not what—

ALI: Mhm.

AUSTIN: —um, he might have called it the Disciples—

KEITH: Yes.

AUSTIN: —but he has not said the Disciples of Fantasmo at any point.

ALI: Yeah.

KEITH: Oh, you think that—I was under the impression that the Disciples of Fantasmo was a newer thing than the symbol.

AUSTIN: Yes. Correct. That is the correct—yes.

ALI: Yeah.

KEITH: Yeah. Yes.

ALI: Yeah.

KEITH: Yes.

AUSTIN: And he says—and he gives it to you. He gives you this box, Lem.

KEITH: Repurpose it.

AUSTIN: And says—the—he says

AUSTIN (as Ventaro): Fero told me about why you’re here and where you are going. 

KEITH: [whispered] I knew it.

AUSTIN (as Ventaro) I need you to take this to your friend.

ALI: [quiet] What? [laughs]

[JACK breathes loudly]

AUSTIN (as Ventaro): The time has come. The plan—the plan is in action. Go. Now.

AUSTIN: And he opens the door.

JACK (as Lem): Wait—now?

AUSTIN: And he—he opens the door.

KEITH: Now.

ALI: [gasps] Sorry. [laughs]

JACK (as Lem): What’s the queen gonna say?

ALI: Mm.

[KEITH and ALI laugh]

AUSTIN: He says—he says—

KEITH: [snotty voice] Lem loves the rules!

[ALI laughs]

AUSTIN: —that things are going just as she willed.

ALI: [mutters] Oh, my god.

JACK (as Lem): All right. Cool. Thank you very much for everything you've done foryou’ve for me while I’ve been here. Um. It has—

KEITH: Whatever that is.

JACK (as Lem): Well. L—listen. Since I left the Archives, I hadn’t met anybody who... Yeah. All right, bye. 

JACK: And I get up.

[KEITH laughs]

AUSTIN: He—he stops—he put a hand on your shoulder and turns you to him. And he says…

AUSTIN (as Ventaro): I’m... not going to lie to you. When our queen told us of this plan I was terrified. Because—and this is selfish—I do believe in what she wants for this world. I do. Really, really, I do. But if it’s—if it costs us Nacre for it. This one beautiful place. This one place where love, and joy, and life stand next to death in harmony. This place with history as old as bones. If it costs us that, I thought, “No, I can’t. I can’t go through with it.” But knowing that there are people like you out there, who will pick through these bones, who will come to our ruins and find some shadow of the glory that was once Nacre. And knowing that you’ll have the time to do it in the world she’s creating. Really, that’s all I need.

JACK (as Lem): I understand. Thank you very much. Is there that I can do now for you?

AUSTIN (as Ventaro): [sighs] Just deliver that box to the man that Fero told you—told me about. I’m not sure that it’s what he’s looking for, but... I need to know. I need to know if things are still—it’s complicated. I have to go. 

AUSTIN: And he gives your shoulder a little squeeze, and then like corrects the glasses on his face and heads out the door.

JACK: I just like… fucking… run for it.

AUSTIN: And then he cl—he—

JACK: Oh, wait, no, go on.

AUSTIN: He calls back, and he says—

	AUSTIN (as Ventaro): Oh. And keep—keep the edition of Grummond’s. It’s yours.

JACK: Aw...

[Laughter]

KEITH: [laughing] Even the appendices?

[Laughter]

AUSTIN (as Ventaro): [laughs] Take my copy, it has the appendices—has the appendices and the index.

[Laughter]

JACK (as Lem): Thank you so much. Thank you. 

JACK: Uh. And then I just like fucking run into the streets.

AUSTIN: Mhm.

JACK: I assume I’m aiming for the palace.

AUSTIN: Yeah, the second your foot hits the streets, you hear a loud, thunderous clap. And behind you, you see the Kingdom Come catch fire as the Ordennan warships move into the bay.

JACK: [whispers] Oh jeez.

AUSTIN: Back in the palace!

KEITH: Hello.

ALI: Uh. Hello. Hiiii?

JACK: Palace team!

AUSTIN: Fero is a bear!

KEITH: I’m a bear. Hi, I’m a bear.

ALI: [dismayed] I’m attacking the queeeeen…

KEITH: Hi, I’m a big fucking bear. 

AUSTIN: Mhm!

KEITH: I haven’t been a bear since the first episode.

AUSTIN: Go for it. You—are you attacking?

ALI: Yeah…

KEITH: I’m going…

JACK: [laughs] Oh no.

KEITH: I’m… here’s what—here’s what I’m gonna do.

AUSTIN: Yeah.

KEITH: I’m not—I’m going to attack. I’m going to talk to you about bear-specific moves?

AUSTIN: Yeah, let’s talk about bears.

KEITH: And I wanna use one of those. I feel like—

JACK: Move A: Honey.

KEITH: —a really good move would be an attack that restrains, a la bear hug.

AUSTIN: Oh, that’s a good one. Yeah.

[JACK and ALI snort]

KEITH: Um.

AUSTIN: That sounds like a thing. Yeah, that’s a Strength check, for sure. Uh, let’s say…

KEITH: Strength check, all right.

AUSTIN: Let’s say—is there—is there—um. Let’s say on a—on a… let me think here, how’s this gonna work? Let me look at Hack & Slash and see if I can just derive it from Hack & Slash really quick. Um. Yeah, I think we can derive it from Hack & Slash.

KEITH: Okay.

AUSTIN: So just do a Hack & Slash, but it’s about restraining her specifically. Um. It’s roll+Strength, and then on a 10+, she’s restrained and you get to do damage, on a 7-9, she is restrained.

ALI: Oh, boy.

KEITH: That was a 12.

AUSTIN: Okay. Um. Go ahead and do your damage.

KEITH: Um. And that’s just 2d6? No. Wait. Is it?

AUSTIN: Yep. No no no, it’s just whatever your—it’s what—it’s whatever your…

ALI: It’s d10 or whatever.

AUSTIN: It’s—yeah. It’s—yeah.

KEITH: Oh, you know what? I have—it’s --

AUSTIN: You know what, yeah! You get a bonus.

KEITH: I keep forgetting, I have Dangerous Attack.

AUSTIN: Yeah, you definitely get a bonus.

KEITH: I get a bonus, because I’m a dangerous animal.

AUSTIN: Yep.

KEITH: Um. I actually think that I ha—do I have the second upgrade of that or just the first?

AUSTIN: I think it’s the first, ‘cause you’re only level three, right? Yeah.

KEITH: Uh… that’s…

AUSTIN: And you did—balance...

KEITH: Rolling d8, that’s a—that’s a 5 damage.

AUSTIN: Okay.

KEITH: And so now I have bal—now I have a hold two? And then I also have one balance left, from forever ago.

AUSTIN: From forever ago, yeah. Uh. All right, so you do five. Um. You lift her into the air, and she is pretty much at ease as you do it. And you squeeze on her, and you feel a few things pop, and she like flinches, but then just looks you in the eyes.

KEITH: Um.

ALI: That’s really... [???]

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): Little bird.

AUSTIN: —she says.

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): Let her come.

[Pause]

[ALI begins laughing]

KEITH: Uh. Who?

[ALI continues laughing]

JACK: Gang of disaster people! Going around.

ALI: [slightly choked] Yeah, I... I—do you want me to just roll? ‘Cause I—[laughs]

AUSTIN: Yeah. 

ALI: Okay.

AUSTIN: I mean, what are you—what are you—wait, what are you doing? Are you going to stab her with the sword?

ALI: S—yeah. Yep.

AUSTIN: Okay. No, I’m not gonna make you roll for it.

KEITH: Does—does He—does Hella get a bonus because of the restraint, or—

AUSTIN: There’s no roll. There’s no roll. 

ALI: [sighing] Right…

KEITH: Okay.

AUSTIN: She’s not resisting this. At all.

KEITH: Right.

ALI: [sighing] Right... ugh…

AUSTIN: Like.

[ALI laughs]

KEITH: Is it because she thinks that the line is unbroken, because of what I said about…

AUSTIN: [agreeably] That is a thing she said. She did say that she c—

KEITH: Right.

AUSTIN: —she didn’t know before this that the line was unbroken…

KEITH: Right.

AUSTIN: That is a thing she said.

KEITH: She did say that.

ALI: Mm.

[AUSTIN sighs]

[ALI laughs]

AUSTIN: You know what, give me—oh, boy.

KEITH: But I—I don’t know! It feels like it’s broken, ‘cause they’re in—they’re in the fucking death chamber!ALI: [sadly] Mhm!

AUSTIN: Yeah.

[JACK laughs]

AUSTIN: [ominously] They—they are in the death chamber, aren’t they?

KEITH: [quickly] They are. Um.

JACK: But you th—thought she’d have worked that out, right?

AUSTIN: What did [???]—

KEITH: Yeah. No. She knows m—she knows more than we do, what’s going on.

AUSTIN: [pretending surprise] Does she? What makes you think that?

ALI: Ugh…

KEITH: [blithely] I don’t know! Uh, because she’s a—she’s the—she e—always—she always knows when I’m in people’s pockets, is why!!

[ALI laughs]

AUSTIN: Well. You know. She does have divine blood in her.

ALI: [faintly] Yeah…

KEITH: Um.

AUSTIN: But there is something—

KEITH: All right, Ali—

AUSTIN: —there is something you’re like very close to realizing, and should maybe think about. And I can like tip it a little bit more.

KEITH: Tip it a little bit more.

AUSTIN [didactic]: The like things she has said. She didn’t know her father was alive. She didn’t know the line had been unbroken. Um. She was surprised to hear that you saw her brother—in—place of her father.

[ALI sighs]

KEITH: I… if the line was u—ah. I don’t know, that—the only—the only thing that that says to me is that she didn’t realize that they were all still immortal.

AUSTIN: Yeah, it’s a big one.

KEITH: Yeah. Which doesn’t make any sense, because—uh—like, she saw people be ghosts and shit.

AUSTIN: Yeah. She saw people be ghosts.

KEITH: And she saw people give up their own lives.

AUSTIN: Right, instead of having someone take it from it from them.

KEITH: Instead of having someone take it from them?

AUSTIN: Instead of having Tristero enact his power to kill.

ALI: S—s—she didn’t realize that Tristero was still do...ing? That?

AUSTIN: She thought there—I—I—she didn’t think there was—

ALI: Or that he was doing that not within Nacre? Or?

AUSTIN: What’s like the story of Nacre? Let’s go over the story of Nacre again.

[amused noises]

KEITH: [accepting] Okay.

AUSTIN: What’s Tristero do? To save Nacre?

JACK: He gives up his power.
KEITH: Uh...

AUSTIN: He gives up his power.

KEITH: He gi—yeah.

AUSTIN: So…

JACK: Oh, wait, what?

AUSTIN: Yeah. She thinks—she thought for... ever—everyone thought forever that there was no more Tristero. That Tristero really only existed as this divine bloodline.

JACK: Right.

AUSTIN: Not that there was anyone ever in…

JACK: Which super isn’t correct.

KEITH: But he existed as the god of the dead of just…

AUSTIN: Of just Nacre.

KEITH: Of just—right.

AUSTIN: [pleased] And in Nacre, no one died anymore.

ALI: Unless they ch—yeah.

AUSTIN: Unless they chose to.

JACK: Which they thought was the case because they just thought that Tristero just didn’t exist anymore.

AUSTIN: Right.

JACK: But presumably was... an active choice on Tristero’s part?

KEITH: Right.

AUSTIN: [very pleased] Yes. Right.

KEITH: So—

JACK: Oh. Hang on. [laughs] Which means—

AUSTIN: The Ordennan warships are firing on the city.

JACK: —I can’t say.

[Laughter]

ALI: I mean, we’ve committed…to this.

AUSTIN: Yeah, I—it’s up to—yeah. You’re totally… yes.

JACK: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Yep!JACK: I—Yeah. All right.

ALI: Hella’s certainly not putting this together.

AUSTIN: No! Okay, that’s fair. I just wanted to—

ALI: Like.

AUSTIN: So the little tip—the little thing that I can—[pauses]

KEITH: Yeah. No.

ALI: [verge of tears] I appreciate it....Hella.can say [???]

AUSTIN: You—okay. Yep.

ALI: But I’m playing Hella.

JACK: Oh man, how far away am I from the palace?

AUSTIN: I appreciate it. Oh, like very far. 

JACK: Oh, good.

AUSTIN: There’s no way you’re gonna get to the palace and climb the stairs and put all this—like there’s no way you’d put this together.

JACK: Bust into the room and go—

AUSTIN: Right.

JACK: —“Listen!”

KEITH: Um. Well, I did—I did ask the—I did ask her a question that she never answered.

AUSTIN: Which one?

KEITH: I—she said “Let her come,” and I said, “Who?”AUSTIN: Oh. Hella!

JACK: Presumably Hella.

AUSTIN: Yeah.

KEITH: Oh, okay. Just making sure that there wasn’t some sort of more interesting answer to that.

AUSTIN: Yes. No. Um. Yeah, she like is in your weird bear grip, and Hella is approaching her. Uh, Hella, before you—you stab her, two things happen. The first is that she nods her head to you and says,

	AUSTIN (as Adelaide): [gently] I always loved the shores of Ordenna in the summer.

AUSTIN: The second thing… is, for just a splitspit second… you swear you hear him say,

	AUSTIN (as Calhoun): [rueful] I can’t stay mad at you.

[ALI squeaks]

AUSTIN: And then you kill her. And his voice is gone. And it won’t come back.

[Silence]

ALI: [very quietly] Fuck. [upset and laughing] I hate Hella. Mm. Okay—I—sure. Okay.

AUSTIN: And she falls. In fact, unlike Angelo, she does not pass through the three stages of death. This blade is magical, it was created—

[ALI makes a crying noise]

AUSTIN: —from a sort of magic that doesn’t have—that we don’t have words for. And it—she is just dead. She is just—she falls flat. And vanishes the same way her brother did.

ALI: [laughs] I’m so upset. [gasps] Mm.

AUSTIN: Um. And the invasion is underway, deep and hard, and it is rough. Lem, you’re headed towards the palace. You need to make a—

JACK: Mhm!

AUSTIN: —give me a Defy Danger: Dex roll.

[45:18]

JACK: Cool. Rolling Dex… Oh dear. Wow, that’s a...

[AUSTIN laughs menacingly]

JACK: Oh, okay. Well, then, fine.

AUSTIN: Okay. Well, I have to give you a hard bargain, a... what is it—it’s a hard bargain, a—you stumble, hesitate—

JACK: Difficult choice.

AUSTIN: Yeah, it’s a worse outcome, hard bargain, or ugly choice.

KEITH: By the way, those were—those were all runners-up for different suits in a deck of cards of Hieron.

[Laughter]

AUSTIN: Uh. You’re running, and you see it. You do, you finally see it. You see the De Salle bakery, and you didn’t know his last name before, but you know it now.

[JACK gasps]

AUSTIN: And he’s in there, and he’s baking bread. And you can see that it—things are just like a mess now because the cannonballs are hitting and he’s covered in flour, and there are people inside sitting at little tables that have—that are like in the process of like trying to turn them over and like hide under them from whatever’s about to happen. And... you can keep going to the palace, or you don’t have to. Or you can stop.

[JACK laughs]

AUSTIN: I don’t know—I don’t think he sees you. You don’t get that. You don’t get to have eye contact unless you want it enough to not go to the palace.

JACK: Is he in danger?

AUSTIN: I mean, the whole city’s in danger. Right?

[Phone alert noise]

JACK: [laughs ruefully] Mm... How am I carrying this box?

AUSTIN: I think it’s under your arm, right. Like it’s a little—it’s like a cigar box in size. It’s like the size of a book.

JACK: How secure is me holding on—like—have I got—how much of a grip—a grisp have I got on this box?

AUSTIN: It’s a—you’re—it’s a solid grab. You can—you can have it.

KEITH: You’re good at grabbin’ stuff.

AUSTIN: You’ve no—there’s no—in fact, you may have even just put in a satchel or something, right? Like, you know, you’re at no risk of losing that box.

JACK: [sighs] I’m trying to think about this. Um. He’s baking, so he doesn’t seem tremendously concerned. Essentially—

AUSTIN: Well, he—he was baking—he’s like—I think he’s just like in the—he had been baking, I should have been more clear. Right, like he was in the middle of baking when all of this jumped off.

JACK: Right.

AUSTIN: And people in the place are now like losing it a little bit and are like nervous, and worried, and are hoping—like they don’t know what the plan is. They’re, you know—it turns out that the things that people were talking about at the palace turned out to be true, I guess! And he is in the back room. You know, he’s probably like—he’s probably putting stuff away. Right, like he’s probably like “Oh, well I have to put this—okay, I have to—well, this has to go back into storage now.”

JACK: Huh.

AUSTIN: But like in my vision of the place, it’s like glass windows with like the—

JACK: Is it like the sort of a bakery that Janine would design in the Sims if she were to make a really nice bakery?

AUSTIN: Yeah. I—there’s—there’s more of a back room though, that’s like visible—it has like—you know like the cut-out in the wall...

JACK: Oh, yeah yeah.

AUSTIN: ...where you can st—that’s where you see him, in the back, in the kitchen, like putting stuff away and hurriedly moving around with, again, little splotches of flour on him. You have to make the decision. You have to either stay—you can...

JACK: Okay! I’m going to the cafe. I’m doubling down.

[ALI makes a high noise]

AUSTIN: [dubious] Okay. Uh.

JACK: Well, no, here’s my thinking, right.

AUSTIN: Uh-huh.

JACK: All of my—

KEITH: Here’s my thinking: I don’t mad—I don’t care how mad this is gonna make Keith!

AUSTIN: Yes. [laughs]

JACK: Well, A, he’s not gonna know. B, [laughs] all the times I’ve even encountered Emmanuel so far, I have been a tourist.

AUSTIN: Mhm.

JACK: I figure in a city that is under attack, conveying a box to my friend in an attempt to escape the city, I might be able to be an adventurer, which is kind of my job?

ALI: Aw.

AUSTIN: Wait, I’m sorry, say that again? Wait wait, what are you doing, here?

JACK: Which might be nice. Every time—I’m—I’m going in there.

AUSTIN: Right, but why—what’s your thinking about thehte box?

JACK: Because my h—No. My hope is that I’ll show myself to be an adventurer. Every time I’ve seen him, I’ve accidentally shown myself to be a tourist.

AUSTIN: Ah, I see what you’re saying. So you want to like make—

JACK: And I’m hoping that—

KEITH: Well, to be fair, the first time you were attacking his ship.

AUSTIN: You’re like looking to like... to make a good impression, basically.

JACK: Yeah, but not like—not like—to the extent of not actually being an adventurer. Like I have—you know.

AUSTIN: Right right right. Um, all right, yeah. You swing in, and you make eye contact with him, and he says—

JACK: Oh, god.

AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): What are you doing?

JACK (as Lem): We need to move, now. Let’s go.

AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): No, I—I—I—I—I...

JACK (as Lem): Out. Quick.

AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): I cannot. I cannot. I have worked—

[ALI laughs]

AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): I have worked too hard for this. This is my place. I’m going to defend it. There’s no—there are no two ways about it.

JACK (as Lem): [hopeful] And nothing’s gonna change your mind, then?

AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): Marjorie, Marjorie. Bar the door...

AUSTIN: And she likes slides the thing in front of the door, and like they begin to like pull down grates on the inside.

AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): You have to leave, Lem.

JACK (as Lem): All right. Okay. 

JACK: So I reach into my pocket, and I give him my business card.

[Laughter]

AUSTIN: He like raises his eyebrow.

AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): [muttering] [surprised] Archivist?

JACK (as Lem): Let me know if you’re um… let—

ALI: [laughing] It’s—

AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): You’re an archivist?

JACK (as Lem): Uh, actually, I mean, yeah.

AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): I thought you were a musician.

JACK (as Lem): [laughs] Uh. There’s lots of us. You know. There’s lots of us.

KEITH: “I thought you were a pirate.”

AUSTIN: [laughs] Yeah.

[ALI laughs]

JACK (as Lem): Yeah. We—we—we do okay. Um. Let me know if you—

AUSTIN: Wooo, [mouth explosion noise]! Explosions outside.

JACK (as Lem): [laughs] Let me know, uh, if you’re—just sort of—north—it—look—you’ll work it out. Just, um. All right. Good luck.

AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): I—I—I...

AUSTIN: He goes—And then he turns. And then lets you go.

JACK: All right.

AUSTIN: Almost.

JACK: Bye!

ALI: I thought that his card would read like, “Lem King: Adventurer.”

AUSTIN: He says—aw, that would’ve been the best!

[KEITH laughs]

JACK: No, it’s—I think it’s a—I think it’s an Archives card.

AUSTIN: Yeah. Yeah.

JACK: You know like the archive badges, like that on a piece of... 

AUSTIN: Mhm.

ALI: Yeah.

JACK: ...lazer-cut wood or whatever, I think it’s one of those. It’s not lazer-cut, honestly. You know what I mean.

ALI: Mm.

AUSTIN: He says—but just as you’re leaving, he says,

AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): [meaningfully] Be safe.

JACK (as Lem): [quietly] Thank you. You too.

AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): Velas. Right?

JACK (as Lem): Yep. That’s the place.

AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): [softly] Velas. All right.

JACK (as Lem): Bear it in mind.

AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): [softly] All right.

AUSTIN: All right, and you’re back out into the streets. 

JACK: Cool...

AUSTIN: Palace! What are you doing, Palace?

[ALI sighs]

KEITH: Um.

ALI: Please... [???]

KEITH (as Fero): So does that mean that we’re—does that mean that everybody’s not immortal anymore? 

KEITH: It’s Fero saying that.

AUSTIN: That is Fero saying that. Yeah.

KEITH (as Fero): Is it—or, we good?

[JACK laughs]

ALI (Hella): I don’t... we should go. I...

KEITH (Fero): I mean. Yeah, right? Like we should get out of here?

KEITH: Ooh, is there anything cool, like in the room?

AUSTIN: There’s like a lot of stuff in the room.

KEITH: Is there anything like particularly that might catch my eye as something u—immediately useful?

AUSTIN: Oh, that’s a good question. Um.

KEITH: Or important. Immediately useful or important.

AUSTIN: ...Yeah. Yes. There are... On her desk, there is a map of Hieron, that has—

KEITH: [accidentally hits mic] Yep.

AUSTIN: That has places on it that you have not seen.

[JACK gasps, ALI laughs]

AUSTIN: Places to the southwest of Rosemerrow. [moves away from mic] Excuse me, I’m, um…

KEITH: Okay.

AUSTIN: One second, let me... or I guess like not the southwest, ‘cause southwest of Rosemerrow is just more ocean.

JACK: Is ocean, right?AUSTIN: Yeah yeah yeah.

KEITH: Mhm.

AUSTIN: Uh. It’s. Let me s—let me think here, what’s the... okay. I will—I will f—ah. Hm. I think we have to fill that map out together later.

KEITH: Yeah.

AUSTIN: But it’s in the kind of southwest quadrant of Hieron.

KEITH: Okay.

AUSTIN: So you have that, and then... there is... what else would be there from her? There’s a really nice pen.

[JACK and ALI laugh]

AUSTIN: It’s the colors of Nacre, with the different colors of white and gold. It’s a heavy pen. It feels... it feels like it has a history to itself? Like it’s the sort of pen—

KEITH: Mhm.

AUSTIN: —that like has signed really important documents.

KEITH: Yeah.

AUSTIN: And it feels like... a little bit like it... I’m trying to think of like the best way to explain this. When you pick it up, there’s the sense that like you could... anything that you think of, you can think about it a little bit better with the pen.

JACK: Hm.

AUSTIN: Like by writing your thoughts out, and giving them time, and like considering things, and like outlining stuff? Um. It—it…

KEITH: Okay.

JACK: It’s the pen that puts you up one on the marks key. [???]

AUSTIN: Right. Exactly. Yes. It’s like it—

KEITH: Got it.

AUSTIN: I—you know, you don’t know if it’s a confidence thing, if it’s like, you know, you go into the test and you have like th—you have your favorite pen, and you just do better because you have your favorite pen! Um.

KEITH: Mhm.

AUSTIN: It’s that.

KEITH: Got it.

AUSTIN: Except maybe also there’s magic involved.

KEITH: Got [laughs] I mean, we can check that out.

AUSTIN: Yeah, exactly.

KEITH: Um. Well, I’m gonna take those things.

AUSTIN: Sure.

KEITH: Uh. Hey, we should get outta here.

ALI: Yep. Is—

KEITH: Sorry that I looked at this pen for ten seconds. We should leave.

ALI: [laughs] I—

AUSTIN: Thief.

[KEITH laughs]

ALI: Yeah, I feel like they’re—well, I guess they’re alone in this room, but I feel like Hella and Fero should have been like expecting... an event that didn’t happen?	KEITH (as Fero): Yeah. I feel like we kind of fucked up in some weird way!

[JACK laughs]

KEITH (as Fero): Anyway, let’s go!

ALI (as Fero): Yeah. Okay, let’s go... Yeah.

AUSTIN: Yeah.

KEITH (as Fero): ‘Cause that was super weird, right? She was just like “Yeah, kill me!” And then she died.

ALI (as Hella): Well, I mean—yeah, she died. But—we’ll go outside, and there won’t be ghosts—

KEITH (as Fero): Okay, we’ll go.

ALI (as Hella): —and it’ll be fine. Let’s just go. Let’s just go.

KEITH (as Fero): We’ll find Lem. I don’t know.

AUSTIN: Lem, give me another Defy Danger. This is the thing, like you’re back in danger. 

JACK: Sure.

AUSTIN: You—you had your escape, and then you gave it away. Defy Danger: Dex, to…

JACK: 9 again!

AUSTIN: All right, look at that. Again, the explosions of the cannons...

JACK: [gasps] Another patisserie!

AUSTIN: ...are—yeah.

[ALI laughs]

[KEITH laughs]

AUSTIN: ...are slamming left and right around you. And... you... I think... [menacingly satisfied] Oh. The book of poetry that you’d been reading, in the Sable Spire, comes undone and like flies out of the satchel you’d been carrying. Thankfully, the box doesn’t, but that does. Um. 

[JACK sighs]

AUSTIN: And you, at this point, can—it goes like down an alleyway. And you can hear, behind you, the sound of like... um... regimented boot steps. Coming down these streets.

JACK: Well, I’m gonna keep going.

AUSTIN: Okay.

JACK: I’vem gotta keep going.

AUSTIN: There goes The Storm Over Tristero, with your poem still in it. Maybe one day, someone else will find the book and add their own to it.

JACK: That’s the plan.

AUSTIN: Yeah. Uh, you make your way to the bottom of the palace, and—both of you—all three of you, all at once—and find each other.

KEITH (as Fero): Oh!

JACK (as Lem): Hey!

KEITH (as Fero): Hey, you’re—

ALI (as Hella): Lem!

KEITH (as Fero): Hey!

JACK (as Lem): You’ll never guess who I ran into.

ALI (as Hella): Yeah.

KEITH (as Fero): Hold on. [excitedly] We killed the queen!

ALI (as Hella): [brightly] Yeah!

JACK (as Lem): Wha... No, you—[laughing] what did—why did you do that?

KEITH (as Fero): Yeah, we killed her!

ALI (as Hella): Yeah, there’s no more immortality!

KEITH (as Fero): Yeah, there’s no more immortality.

JACK (as Lem): W—w—hang on a second. Um.

ALI (as Hella): Let’s walk and talk.

KEITH (as Fero): Yeah, we did it.

ALI (as Hella): Let’s walk and talk, but we’re fine.

KEITH (as Fero): We’ll walk and talk, there’s bombs.

JACK (as Lem): What about Emmanuel?

KEITH (as Fero): What about—what are you—what are you—[yelling] what are you talking about, what about Emmanuel!

JACK (as Lem): He—he—

ALI (as Hella): Who is Emmanuel?

KEITH (as Fero): What the fu—Lem, what are you talking about, what about Emmanuel? What does he have to do with literally anything!?

JACK (as Lem): [panicking] He—ah—well, how do you know that there’s no more immortality?

KEITH (as Fero): Ahhh…

ALI (as Hella): We broke—

KEITH (as Fero): …’cause of the—it—

ALI (as Hella): We broke the line!

KEITH (as Fero): —we broke the line of… Tristero?

JACK (as Lem): What are you talking about?

KEITH (as Fero): Yeah, when you kill—‘cause then now there’s no—no more of them.

ALI (as Hella): Right.

JACK (as Lem): Of—ah—

ALI (as Hella): [proud] That’s how lines work!

JACK (as Lem): I—listen. I have this box. It is very important. I am not going to give it to you because you’ll drop it or something. Let’s go.

KEITH (as Fero): [offended] I’ve never dropped a thing in my life!

JACK (as Lem): Yeah.

KEITH (as Fero): W—also, where are we going? Are we going—are we just gonna run to our boat?

JACK (as Lem): It’s probably on fire.

KEITH (as Fero): Remember our boat, with the people on it?

AUSTIN: Uh.

ALI (as Hella): That might be the wr—oh…

AUSTIN: Yeah, that might be the wrong direction. You’re not foolish enough to miss that fact. Um, like—

JACK: What about just north?KEITH: Okay. Well I was—I was imagining them coming from—they’re coming from the south—

AUSTIN: No they’re coming—

KEITH: Uh, the south-east, right --AUSTIN: No, they’re coming from the west.

KEITH: —that’s where they’re coming from.

AUSTIN: When you look at the map of Nacre, like—they’re just coming—

KEITH: Sorry, that’s what I meant, the southwest. I thought it was—

AUSTIN: No, they’re just coming—they’re—

JACK: They’re a goddamn invasion fleet.

AUSTIN: It’s an invasion fleet. 

KEITH: Got it.

AUSTIN: Their fleet is off that coast of Nacre. Like you could make that run, like who even knows what’s up with that boat at this point. [laughs]

[JACK laughs]

KEITH: They probably sailed home.

AUSTIN: They probably sailed home!

JACK: [solemnly] Party boat.

ALI: Oh, I hope so.

KEITH: They probably sailed home.

ALI: I really hoped that after a day they were just like “What are we doing here?”

KEITH: They—yeah, they sobered up. They waited until maybe they didn’t have the worst hangover of all time, and then they said “They’re probably fine. Let’s go.”

ALI: I... Yeah. I don’t... No. Yeah, no. 

ALI (as Hella): Yeah, no, we should not go towards the boat. They’re distracted, they’re not gonna—

JACK (as Lem): Um.

KEITH (as Fero): Okay. What, like south then?

AUSTIN: You can head—there is that road east past the palace that [???]

ALI (as Hella): We—we have to go back to Velas. We’re not... I—yeah. No. We have to go back. Mm. Hadrian’s in trouble. We’ll just have to go. We have to go. We have to go.

KEITH (as Fero): Let’s—mm—let’s get a—Hadrian’s fine, what are you talking about—it’s fine.

ALI (as Hella): We’ll talk about it later, it’s just—we have to go.

KEITH (as Fero): Let’s just go—let’s go… Sure, let’s go east and then we’ll figure it out. Okay. But like, hold on. This fleet is—like, we’re good? We saved the day?

ALI (as Hella): Yeah.

JACK (as Lem): No. We did the exact opposite of saving the day.

ALI (as Hella): No!

KEITH (as Fero): Mm. I don’t know --

JACK (as Lem): You have screwed—

KEITH (as Fero): —what are you...?

JACK (as Lem): everything up.
 
KEITH (as Fero): How so?

JACK (as Lem): You know everybody here is going to die, right?

ALI (as Hella): Yeah, that’s fine—

KEITH (as Fero): Yeah.

ALI (as Hella): —but the Ordennans are safe now!

KEITH (as Fero): That’s what we—we did that on purpose.

JACK (as Lem): You just—you j—y—y—ah…

KEITH (as Fero): They’re all gonna die ‘cause they’re not immortal.

ALI (as Hella): Right!

JACK (as Lem): Y—yeah.

KEITH (as Fero): Right. So it’s just gonna be like a regular battle—

JACK (as Lem): It’s gonna be a rout.

KEITH (as Fero)—and then the world isn’t gonna become infected with immortality.

ALI (as Hella): Yeah, but like people will remain safe from this curse.

JACK (as Lem): And this city will be completely destroyed.

ALI (as Hella): Who cares about this city?!

KEITH (as Fero): Yeah—sh—yeah. But whatever! [laughs] Who gives a shit!

[1:00:06]

[Pause]

JACK (as Lem): Yeah. You, uh... [laughs] you ever wonder why we’re called the New Archives? 

[ALI laughs]

[AUSTIN snorts]

JACK (as Lem): Uh, we got a history with things being destroyed, so... yeah, you’ve done a great job. Let’s go.

KEITH (as Fero): [loudly] All right, let’s go. He’s cool with it! Come on, let’s go!

[ALI laughs]

KEITH: No. But, for real, here’s the thing. Like—one city versus—like a fuckin’ lot of cities—

AUSTIN: There’s no—there’s no… you have to let it go. You have to have that moment.

JACK: I’m just not comfortable with…

AUSTIN: That’s the scene. Um. And you—

KEITH: I—

AUSTIN: —you find—it’s really weird, like how—you kind of just have an intuition, like “Oh yeah, we could just go—” uh, Hella has the intuition. “Oh right, I know where the escape supplies will be.” You just kn—it’s weird, how you know where they are. But you do.

[ALI laughs]

AUSTIN: And they’re in a little—they’re in like a little alcove underneath the... There’s like a little garden area in the palace that looks out to the east, and kind of to the road coming in from the east? And underneath—it’s like a—that garden is like a—it’s a raised garden on another level, and then underneath that, there are like some gardening supplies and stuff, and in there there are just like horses prepared, and rations, and food. Um. And again and again, you’re like, “Oh yeah, we turn this way, and then this way, and then… okay, cool.” And at least twice, you swear that guards are going to stop you, and then they go like,

AUSTIN (as Guards): Uh, hal—uh—uh—g—carry on.

AUSTIN: —and let you go.

KEITH: That sounds fucked up, something’s wrong.

ALI: That’s weird.

KEITH: That’s really weird.

AUSTIN: And the sounds of fighting in Nacre continue, as you... begin to leave the Empire of Pearls behind.

The first time one of the ancient towers falls, it gives you a jolt. The fifth time... you’re not even sure it’s a loss anymore.

[Pause]

AUSTIN: You take the road north, towards Velas. And—one of the last things you see, looking back... are—at the farms, east of the town... They have meagre farms, I’ve mentioned once or twice. This is why Brandish has to go, uh... has to go rob and pillage to get the food supplies to feed the living people of Velas? 

KEITH: Mhm.

AUSTIN: But there are little meagre farms, just to the east, outside of the city—or, sorry, not Velas, of Nacre, to feed the people of Nacre. And just to the east, there are a l—couple of farms that you pass through, and you see three children, two living children, and one who is a ghost, flying kites. For some reason, that stays in your mind.

The road back is long and quiet, but at least you have food. At least the weather is good. You’re not sure what happened to the people of Nacre. Maybe we’ll find out again in the future. Maybe we’ll see... what happened to all of this.

You get back to Velas. And... a few things happen that we need to address. The first is that you can’t seem to find Gregalos. The man you were sent to—the man who sent you away. You do, however, manage to... leave the box in a secured place for him. There is a day, about a week after you’d arrived, where you think you see him. Someone like down the road gives you a little wave and like a—whatever the Velasian of a thumbs up is, as if to say, “Yeah, got it! Good job, guys!”

KEITH: It’s a flat, straight hand pointing.

AUSTIN: Yeah. Got it. Um. So that’s one thing that happens. The second thing that happens… Hella, you, on one—one day, you kind of do your kind of normal stop by the, uh… V—the Velasian—the Ordennan embassy in Velas?

ALI: Mhm.

AUSTIN: And you kind of get the feeling that things are going real well in Ordenna. You know, you can’t really say like “Oh, did you invade that ghost city?” 

[ALI laughs]

AUSTIN: That’s not really a thing you can say? But th—and—mostly is like, who even knows if the people at this embassy know what’s happening? But the reports that they’re getting are saying that like the Ordennan military strength has increased. They say it’s increased threefold.

KEITH: [musing] Yeah, they really should be charged with like war crimes or something.

ALI: [sarcastically] Nooo…

JACK: Oh, now you’re... now you’re…

[ALI laughs]

KEITH: Listen, it’s—

[MUSIC - “AUTUMN NOT WINTER” begins]

KEITH—just because one person—just because Nacre was fucked up doesn’t mean Ordenna’s not also fucked up.

AUSTIN: The next thing to mention is that it’s sunny. It’s hot. It’s getting so, so hot. And it’s on one of these hot days that the three of you find yourselves in the Garden District of Velas. Kind of walking around, and—separately. Just trying to come to, uh, some... some peace with the strange events that have happened. Over the last couple of weeks of your lives. And out on the beaches, you see a group of people setting up, uh… the… one of the festivities for the upcoming High Sun Day. It’s... a couple of men are in an argument about which kite should be flown higher. Whether the symbol of Velas should be the highest one in the sky, or the symbol of Samothes. You think one of them is one of the priests, down at the... the temple. But, you know, none of you are really religious types. And Hella, you just wonder... when Hadrian’s gonna get back.

ALI: Mm.

AUSTIN: I think that’s the season.

[MUSIC ends]

ALI [upset]: Oh. Oh, boy.

[JACK sighs]

AUSTIN: Let’s level up. Let’s do XP.

ALI [horrified]: Oh, god…

JACK: We made it.

AUSTIN: [rueful] Yeah.

[ALI laughs]

JACK: I’m just gonna run to the bathroom really quickly before we do XP, if that’s okay?

AUSTIN: Sounds good. Sounds good.

[quiet door noise]

ALI: S—mm. [laughs]

KEITH: So, uh, Austin!

AUSTIN: Yep.

KEITH: Austin. Was the thing that you were trying to hint to us that the like—now these people can die?

AUSTIN: No!

KEITH: And that there’s an army coming?

AUSTIN: That was not the thing!

KEITH: Okay, that’s what it—that’s what—that’s what—

AUSTIN: Sorry, I should—that was the thing that you believed would happen before this episode started.

KEITH: Right. Yeah.

AUSTIN: And I was trying to say you were completely wrong about that.

KEITH: That’s… Right, that’s what I thought.

AUSTIN: Okay.

KEITH: But then Jack said something that made me think that I missed something.

AUSTIN: No.

KEITH: Um.

ALI: Oh boy… [sing-song] We did some stuff.

AUSTIN: Mhm.

ALI: [sing-song] ‘Cause we thought it would be good.

AUSTIN: Yep.

[ALI laughs]

AUSTIN: Things are complicated now!

KEITH: Can’t blame us!

AUSTIN: Things are—are—yeah.

KEITH: We made the—I feel like we made the only real choice.

AUSTIN: Eh. There are lots of things that you could have done there. There really are.

KEITH: I... well, there are lots—we made the only real choice that makes sense for me.

AUSTIN: I think that makes sense, yeah yeah yeah, for your character… well. Yeah.

ALI: Yeah. I…

AUSTIN: You—you would…

KEITH: For my character and for me personally, like I’m not like...

AUSTIN: Right. If you—here’s the thing, if you had gone to Lem first and tried to figure out what had happened together, I think you could have come up with a different plan.

ALI: Yeah.

AUSTIN: That’s one way that that could have shaken out differently. Another way to sh—

ALI: S—

AUSTIN: —have it shake out differently is like “Fuck this court shit.”

ALI: Oh.

AUSTIN: Bend bars, lift gates, bounce. Like that’s it. 

ALI: Oh, yeah.

AUSTIN: You know, like that’s totally... A lot of things could be different.

KEITH: Yeah.

ALI: Um. So it’s Adelaide instead of Calhoun now?

AUSTIN: Yeah, actually, I should have given—that’s the scene I fucking forgot about.

[ALI sighs]

AUSTIN: I’m gonna wait until Jack’s back. To do that scene.

ALI: Okay...

KEITH: Are you saying—

AUSTIN: We’ll get there.

KEITH: Are you—so—okay.

ALI: I’m so mad about that. [sad laugh] It’s okay. Oh, it’s fine.

AUSTIN: Yeah. You’ll have to—

KEITH: It’s fine, now you haven’t doomed Calhoun to an eternity of sitting and doing nothing.

AUSTIN: —you’ll have to splice this—yeah. That is true. That is true.

KEITH: Like that’s—like that’s also a win for me.

ALI: [weakly] We could—but maybe we would have hung out sometimes... [laughs]

KEITH: I—Yeah, but I wouldn’t have hung out with him.

ALI: Like. Like years from now.

KEITH: Who ca—that’s not—that doesn’t affect me at all.

ALI: [???] was like super affectionate and I’m so mad. [very sad laugh]

KEITH: I would have been more mad if I really—if I knew that you were able to hang out Calhoun still.

ALI: Oh... pals. Mh.

JACK: [quietly] Hey.

AUSTIN: Hey.

ALI: As a player, I’m so—

AUSTIN: Welcome back. There is one more scene that I was just reminded of, Jack. I’m sorry.

JACK: Oh. No, go.

AUSTIN: Which is—I don’t think it even happens at first. It—it does, it takes a week before this happens. It’s—it might be on the eve of High Sun Day. Um. When she finally comes to Hella. In her sleep.

The palace in your dream is devastated. 

[ALI sighs]

AUSTIN: The windows are smashed. The gold runs across the floor like a splotch of paint. Ah. As if—as if it turned liquid under the heat of Ordennan metal... and just flowed across the throne room, until it eventually solidified and dried. And there she is, sitting on the broken throne, in all of her glory, still. A chest wound. 

[ALI snorts]

AUSTIN: Blood on her dress. But there. And smiling.

AUSTIN (as Adelaide): “My Ordennan sister.”

AUSTIN: —she says.

ALI: Oh.

AUSTIN: And I think that’s the season. I don’t think I have any other season-enders in me.

[ALi laughs sadly]

AUSTIN: Yeah.

KEITH: Hidden bits?

JACK: If they click the right easter egg on the DVD menu, they get a scene in the... in the pub.

[ALI laughs]

AUSTIN: Yeah.

[KEITH laughs]

AUSTIN: Yeah.

ALI: Oh, god.

AUSTIN: Yeah, they... [laughs] Yeah… Oh… 

ALI: Yeah, Hella isn’t—sad… [???]

AUSTIN: They get the scene—they get the scene of Jack in the pub getting—or of Lem in the pub getting a piece of bread and thinking deeply about Emmanuel.

ALI: Aw.

JACK: [laughing] Aw. Aw.

AUSTIN: That’s the…

JACK: Jeez. Yeah.

ALI: Oh, I’m so mad… [???]

AUSTIN: Uh, so yeah, let’s do XP.

JACK: Let’s—let’s do XP.

AUSTIN: Um. [typing noises] Shh…

JACK: I only had one from that, I think, I only failed one roll.

AUSTIN: From the—from the failed roll. And then—

JACK: Mhm.

KEITH: I missed two.

AUSTIN: Right, so that’s two there. And then... um... do do do... Let me get the actual XP thing… Why am I bad at looking through this book…? There are bookmarks. I could just use the bookmarks.

KEITH: There’s uh, defeat an enemy.

AUSTIN: Yeah. It’s def—it’s—okay, so it’s... um. Bonds first.

KEITH: Okay.

AUSTIN: Explore no longer relevant or otherwise. I—I—

KEITH: Oh! Uh, Lem and I have fought together for our lives, we are like brothers?

AUSTIN: Yeah, I don’t think that’s—

JACK: [amused] Oh, god.

AUSTIN: I think that’s resolved.

KEITH: And like I just super don’t know what any of my relationship with Lem is at this point...

AUSTIN: Yep.

KEITH: ...and. Uh, so should I del—should I remove the bond—

AUSTIN: R—r—resolve it.

KEITH: —or replace it—resolve it and replace it with nothing, or go “I don’t know what the state of our relationship is.”

AUSTIN: Uh, resolve it, and then... One second, let me... The thing that [laughs]—the thing that we should all do next is relisten to those specializ—to that—the, uh... I was reading something else on my computer. The Holiday Specials.

JACK: Yeah. Yeah.

KEITH: Mhm.

AUSTIN: Because that’s what should guide your—

KEITH: Oh. Sorry. I’ve heard—I’ve heard it enough.

AUSTIN: Yeah, it’s—that’s fair.

[JACK laughs]
AUSTIN: But you should revisit that to figure out what your next... Bond should be?

JACK: Mhm.

KEITH: Okay, yeah.

AUSTIN: Uh. Because that’s—

JACK: ‘Cause these should be Bonds post Holiday Special.

AUSTIN: Post Holiday Special.

KEITH: I—should we make an exception where—it doesn’t have to add to XP, but to remove multiple Bonds if like—if they just don’t line up?

AUSTIN: Yeah, I think at this point, let’s—let’s... Yeah. I’m ready to like throw Bonds away. Um.

JACK: Okay.

AUSTIN: Not throw them away, but like.

KEITH: Not throw Bonds, but like—[???]

AUSTIN: Uh, but like—

KEITH: Throw them away to the extent of relisten to the Holiday episode and then decide where we stand.

AUSTIN: Right, right. So like—

ALI: Right. Where we’re gonna start next season.

AUSTIN: I think—for—right. For Fero, I think both the Lem one and the Hella one—

KEITH: And the Hella one.

AUSTIN: can both go and change. I like leaving the Hadrian one—

KEITH: I agree.

AUSTIN: —especially after the thing that Hella said about Hadrian being in danger?

KEITH: I agree. That one still fits.

AUSTIN: That fits in an interesting way.

KEITH: Yeah. From Hadrian and for Hadrian.

AUSTIN: Right. Exactly.

ALI: What’s your bond with Hadrian?KEITH: I sense a great danger from Hadrian.

ALI: Oh…

AUSTIN: Yeah. Hella…

KEITH: ‘Cause he’s always fuckin’ doing shit.

AUSTIN: Hella, I think that same thing for you…? I think Fero… uh, maybe—I don’t know. Definitely think Lem needs to—something has to happen with Lem, though.

ALI: Um. Yeah, I…

KEITH: If anything, I’m more dependable!

JACK: Eh.

ALI: [laughs] Yeah, no. I think the one with Fero should stay. ‘Cause I think that like attitude about Fero is gonna stay until the…
 
AUSTIN: Yeah. Okay.

ALI: Um. I have like [laughs]... Every time I listen to one of our episodes, I’m always like “I should have changed my Bond with Hadrian.” [laughs] Um. And I guess…

AUSTIN: This is an opportunity to do it, given that letter.

ALI: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Um. I think that’s fair.

ALI: ‘Cause like I can get rid of the Lem one, and then... Oh, god… [unsure] Can we talk on wording later?

AUSTIN: Yeah, sure.

ALI: Okay.

AUSTIN: But let’s make sure we do it, because otherwise we’ll forget and it will be months from now before we fix it.

ALI: Yeah, I…

KEITH: Mhm.

ALI: Oh, Hella’s feelings... [laughs] are so tough! Um. But yeah, no, I—like after recording. Um. But yeah, I think that should change…

AUSTIN: Okay. I think it’s—

KEITH: Oh man, I have throwing knives. I forgot about my throwing knives.

AUSTIN: [laughs] And then Jack, Lem’s.

JACK: Hm. Yeah, so, um… 

AUSTIN: [amused] Huh.

JACK: There’s “Fero’s desire for heroics is hurtful.”

AUSTIN: Yeah.

JACK: Which is an interesting one.

AUSTIN: Yeah.

[1:15:15]

JACK: Um. Especially because I don’t even know if Fero was acting out of heroics, or if he was just… I don’t even know.

AUSTIN: Yeah…

[JACK laughs]

KEITH: You don’t know, or Lem doesn’t know?

JACK: Lem doesn’t know. Like.

KEITH: Right.

JACK: Lem is just completely… Yeah. So I think that one’s gonna go. [laughs]

AUSTIN: Yeah.

JACK: Um. Do I get XP for getting rid of it.

AUSTIN: Yeah yeah, you get XP for resolving. One XP for resolving.

JACK: Cool.

AUSTIN: For sure.

JACK: Um. I have one that goes “I resent the fact that Hella thinks I’m naive?” And I don’t know if that one—if we’ve gone like—[???]

AUSTIN: [sighs] Yeah, I don’t know. It’s close, but it hasn’t—it doesn’t feel like it’s guided anything yet. You know what I mean?

JACK: [agreeing] No.

AUSTIN: Um. So…

JACK: And then I have “Fantasmo’s disregard for semiotics is [???]”

AUSTIN: Yeah, uh, leave that, because we don’t know where the next season’s going.

JACK: Well—

AUSTIN: And that’s an important—

JACK: Well, even—also, even post Holiday episode.

AUSTIN: Yeah.

JACK: Lem got big questions about that.

AUSTIN: Yes. Yes. Exactly. So I think that deserves to stay.

JACK: Mhm. Yeah.

AUSTIN: I will remind you all that you all get another one from the Holiday Special that I’d written down then. So add that now, because the Holiday Special comes next, and that’s…

AUSTIN: Yeah.

KEITH: Okay.

JACK: So we two—I get two into Bonds now.

AUSTIN: Yes. And then…

JACK: Yep. Cool.

ALI: Wait.

AUSTIN: No no, not new Bonds. Sorry, sorry, sorry. I meant XP. You get—everybody gets one extra XP from the Holiday Special...

JACK: Oh.

ALI: Okay.

AUSTIN: ...that we hadn’t added yet. Um. The next thing is Alignment.

KEITH: Uh. I feel like this is the first where I maybe have gone with my Alignment?

AUSTIN: Mhm.

KEITH: Um, by killing the—

AUSTIN: Correct, yeah. Destroy a symbol of the old world, yeah. Absolutely take a point for that.

KEITH: Or by assisting with the—yeah.

ALI: And then I get one too…!

AUSTIN: Yeah! Absolutely. You destroyed something rather than tried to understand it. For—

ALI: [laughing] I definitely had that opportunity, and threw it out.

AUSTIN: Yep. Um. And I’m gonna give Lem one, for defusing a tense situation and getting—and like managing to get Hella not... be... killed.

JACK: Okay. Yeah, cool.

AUSTIN: Um. Next up is, learning something new and important about the world. Yes.

ALI: Mm…

[JACK laughs]

AUSTIN: Notable monster or enemy, yes…?

KEITH: Yes.

AUSTIN: And memorable treasure, the map, yes.

ALI: We all have weird maps now.

KEITH: Man, I got a fucking ton of XP.

AUSTIN: Everybody has weird maps. Yeah.

JACK: I have a pretty normal map, I think. I think my map’s just of the northwest region.

AUSTIN: Yeah, you have the—you have the map of the world that we actually already knew.

ALI: Oh, okay.

AUSTIN: But—but—

KEITH: Um. I leveled that game.

AUSTIN: Good job!

KEITH: Thank you! I’m very excited.

JACK: Yeah, I leveled up too.

AUSTIN: Yeah, I think everybody should be at the very—

ALI: I’m one… Well, I—once I figure out my Bond situation—

AUSTIN: Right. Right. That’ll do it.

ALI: —with Hadrian I’ll level? Okay.

AUSTIN: Yep.

ALI: Oh my goodness.

AUSTIN: All right.

ALI: What a season!

AUSTIN: What a season.

JACK: That was super great.

AUSTIN: What a season, what a season. [laughs] We’ll, uh…

JACK: Autumn.

AUSTIN: Yeah.

ALI: Oh, my god…

AUSTIN: We’ll be back with something.

KEITH: Um.

AUSTIN: What were you gonna say, Keith?

KEITH: Yeah. Oh, I was gonna say, at what—at what number do we st—do the—do the... attribute bonuses change? [???]

AUSTIN: It just—and it should just happen in this—in this thing automatically.

KEITH: It’s not happening for me? I don’t know what… Oh, wait.

AUSTIN: Yeah, right, you have to hit—yeah, you have to hit the buttons.

KEITH: It just happened, okay.

AUSTIN: Um. To mess with it.

KEITH: I had been, but it was—it—I just didn’t realize that it took so long to get a fucking crisp [???]

AUSTIN: Yeah. Yeah, it takes a bit. Um. All right. My name is Austin Walker. You can find me on Twitter @austin_walker, on Twitch at thecalcutec and at Stream Friends, twitch.tv/streamfriends, twitch.tv/thecalcutec. You can read the stuff that I write at ClockworkWorlds.com. I also—by the time you’re hearing this, I should have started to play in… a livestreamed tabletop game of Apocalypse World. Apocalypse World is the game that Dungeon World was a—is based on. And it’s kind of a hack of. And that game is being run by Adam Koebel, who is one of the co-creators of Dungeon World!

[ALI laughs]

JACK: Oh, man.

AUSTIN: So—and that is part of the official Roll20 campaign. Presumably, Adam knows how to use Roll20 way better than I do! Because [laughs] this whole season has been me struggling to run this game on Roll20. Not ‘cause Roll20 is bad, because I am not necessarily very good at using Roll20. But—

KEITH: It’s been almost seamless.

[JACK laughs]

ALI: You’ve also like played like four games on—[laughs] on Roll20 within this game?

AUSTIN: That’s true. That’s fair.

[ALI laughs]

AUSTIN: That’s fair. Um. That will be… where will that be? That will be on the internet somewhere. That will be on… and you should—you should go listen to that, or watch it, ‘cause there’ll be archives of it. Sorry, I’m trying to get the web—the web address, but my browser is being really bad… That will be—great, this—okay. Nope! The thing that I was looking at just literally doesn’t have a web address for where it’s going to happen where people can see it. So, cool. Follow me on Twitter. Just—

ALI: Check the—check the Roll20 blog. You’re fine. [???] good.

AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah. Ali, where can people find you?

ALI: Um, yeah, I’m Alisha Acampora. You can find me @ali_west on Twitter. I am, of course, a Stream Friend. And if you’re listening to this, and this is our season end, and you feel like you’re gonna miss Hella a little bit, ‘cause I’m not gonna be playing her for a while? You should definitely check out my Sims streams, where she is a charactercharacetr in my Sims 4 household.

[AUSTIN laughs]

ALI: She is probably gonna be a detective with Drake. Draker the rapper.

AUSTIN: The rapper. Who else is in that house? With Hella and Drake?

ALI: So. So it’s me as a ghost, because of course. Um. Vin Diesel.

AUSTIN: You—you—Ali the ghost, not Hella the ghost.

ALI: Yes. [laughs] No no no, yeah. Oh god, Hella as a ghost, oh god.

AUSTIN: Yeah.

ALI: So it’s me, Ali, Vin Diesel, Drake the rapper - Aubrey Graham—um. And Hella Veral.

AUSTIN: Great!

ALI: Um.

JACK: It is a good gang.

AUSTIN: That’s a good gang.

ALI: We have fun there. You should come check it out.

AUSTIN: [amused noise] Keith, where can people find you?

KEITH: Uh, you can find me on Twitter @keithjcarberry, you can find the Let’s Plays that I do at RunButton.net or youtube.com/Runbutton. You can always check out my Patreon for that stuff at contentburger.biz, and I’m about to put up—

AUSTIN: Oh, yeah.

KEITH: —by the time that this is out, I will have started a brand new podcast, also on Run Button, but I’m sure it’ll be on iTunes also, called How Are You Today, which is a mostly-comedy podcast with me interviewing uh guests that are friends of mine usually.

AUSTIN: Like?KEITH: Uh, like Austin was in the first episode, Ali was in the first episode, and my friend Andi Short was in the first episode!

AUSTIN: Rad. Jack? Where can people find you?

KEITH: Jack will have been in an episode by the time this out probably also.

[JACK laughs]

AUSTIN: Where can people find you, Jack?

JACK: My name’s Jack de Quidt, you can find me on Twitter @notquitereal, um… sometimes on Stream Friends. At my game studio, theTallTreesGames.co.uk. And sometimes I write stuff at tinyletter.com/notquitereal.

AUSTIN: It’s so good. Please sign up for Jack’s letter, it is the best.

[JACK laughs]

ALI: Mhm.

AUSTIN: If you like Dungeon World, if you like our campaign, if you like Friends at the Table, you should absolutely be subscribed to Jack’s tinyletter. That’s tinyletter.com/notquitereal. Um. I kinda wanna do a decompression—like a debrief. At some point. Episode, maybe.

JACK: Yep.

KEITH: Mhm.

AUSTIN: After this goes up?

KEITH: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Or after the last episode?

ALI: Yeah.

KEITH: How—does Ice—

AUSTIN: Ice Party’s done.

KEITH: Does Ice Party kind of have a lot more episodes than we do?

AUSTIN: No, no. We’re good now. 

KEITH: is I feel like there's an’ a uneven amount.

AUSTIN: No, we’ve evened out. Like we might have to—might have to like mess with episode lengths, a little bit? To make sure that it comes out exactly right. But they’re done.

KEITH: Okay.

AUSTIN: We’re done now. And, uh…

ALI: We’ll do like a postmortem.

AUSTIN: We’ll do a postmortem, or maybe a stream, even. Maybe we’ll do like a livestream…

JACK: Yeah.

ALI: Yeah, I really hope it’s a livestream.

AUSTIN: ...conversation with everybodyeverbody. I would like to do that. And, ideally, maybe we could even like… we’ll see. We’ll—oh yeah, we have things. We can have things to talk about.

JACK: We’ll do some special stuff.

AUSTIN: Yep. So—

ALI: If you’re listening to this, the next episode is gonna be really good, we have more in store for you.

AUSTIN: Yep! Bye, everybody.

JACK The world is abundant.

[ALI and AUSTIN laugh]

ALI: Thanks for listening.

JACK: Bye-bye.

AUSTIN: And thanks to Keith for—for editing this whole first season.

JACK: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Uh, Nick stepped in there for a while while Keith’s computer fell apart. And Keith—Keith and Jack, thank you—

KEITH: Yeah, yeah, he def—

AUSTIN: —so much for helping me figure out the aesthetic for what I was going for here. Like when we first had this conversation, almost a year ago, about what this game was gonna sound like and be like. We definitely had like some ideas, but like between Jack’s music throughout the season, and Keith, your kind of like guiding producer—you know, production. We’ve really created, I think, a tone that is unique in the Actual Play space. So I really appreciate it.

JACK: Thank you.

KEITH: Course, thank you.

JACK: It’s been super good fun.

AUSTIN: All right.

KEITH: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Let’s time.is. [laughs]

KEITH: All right.

JACK: [wistfully] Ah, the final time.is. Ah…

AUSTIN: Of the season! Of the season.

JACK: Yes.

KEITH: Right, right. Of the season.

AUSTIN: Uh, don’t—

JACK: Let’s clap extra bad.

AUSTIN: People who are worried, this doesn’t mean that we’re not gonna be doing stuff between now and—there’s—we have—

KEITH: Oh, yeah yeah yeah.

AUSTIN: We have plans.

ALI: Yeah.

KEITH: We have interim plans.

AUSTIN: Okay, let’s go—

JACK: We have secret plans.

KEITH: I’m really excited for our interim plan, by the way.

AUSTIN: Me too, let’s do f—

ALI: Mhm.

AUSTIN: At forty-five, we’re gonna do it at forty-five.

KEITH: It’ll be fun. ‘Cause you mentioned how—okay.

JACK: No spoilers.

[Four completely separate, off-beat claps]

AUSTIN: Hm. That was pretty good.

KEITH: Perfect. Fucking perfect.

AUSTIN: Finally.

ALI: We did it.

JACK: Nailed it.

AUSTIN: We did it. It took a season, but we did it.

KEITH: Um.

[Episode ends]
