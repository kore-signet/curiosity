(or the video! :D)
0:00-20:00 transcribed by clover shledzguohn; Cole to finish
Jack: I'll op-- I'll open up Audacity.
Austin: Add a new window capture… 
Dre: Ooh, are we gonna clap on stream?
Austin:  We are on. Hey. Hi?
Ali: Oh, hello!
Keith: Hey!
Dre: Oh, hello?
Jack: Hello!
Austin: Are we?
Art: Hey.
Dre: The internet?
Keith: That sound-- that sounds right!
Austin: That sounds right.
Ali: There’s a tweet out.
Dre: It says- Yeah, this is live.
Austin: Is there a tweet?
Ali: Yeah, there’s a tweet. I’m retweetin’ it.
Jack: Mhm.
Austin: Let’s pop that up… Let’s put that right up top here. So I can read it when I want it.
Ali: We’re here~!
Nick: Is this… Do we need to see this stuff?
Austin: No, no.
Nick: We did- Ok. 
Austin: No, I’m just fuckin’ with… stuff. It’s great.
Dre: Looks nice, Austin!
Austin: Thank you! I don’t know what to do with that black space, but, like, we’ll live, I guess. [Jack laughs]
Art: I guess. 
Austin: I’m gonna estimate. Let’s say-
Art: If you can call that living.
Keith: I dunno! It looks like, it looks intentional and good.
Jack: Yeah, definitely!
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Except for the bit where I said ‘I don’t know what to do with this black space.’
Keith: Well, no, that also looks intentional.
Jack: No, that’s-
Austin: Oh, that’s good.
Jack: That’s an incantation. It means that people can’t see it. 
Austin: There we go. 
Jack: Nobody would have noticed it if you hadn’t brought it up. [Ali and Keith laugh]
Austin: All right, are we ready to- Are we ready to-?
Keith: Yes.
Austin: Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. I just thought of something else. This is…
Dre: Oh?
Austin: I’m, I’m a fool. I’m a fool. Uh…
Keith: We got a few minutes.
Dre: Austin. You’re an all-star.
Austin: I do okay.
Keith: Okay… [laughs]
Nick: Get your game on.
Austin: I thought of a thing that we don’t have… that I should have … We didn’t think this through. Clearly.
Jack: Ohh no…!
Austin: Oh, there we go. We’re good, we’re good now. All right, what do we want to clap on?
Art: What are we even talking about? Are people like, looking at the…
Austin: Do we wanna clap at--
Keith: We should clap on 25.
Ali: 25, yeah.
Keith: 25.
Austin: 25’s so soon!!
Keith: Okay, 30! 
Dre: Yeah. 
Keith: We can clap at 30! It’s 10 seconds.
Austin: But you said 25. We can do 25.
Jack: Okay, 25, 25.
[clap clap-clap  clap                         clap]
Keith: No we can’t do 25, clearly!
Austin: All right, all right, 35.
[intro music starts]
Keith: So now we’re doing 40.
Austin: Ok. 40.
Ali: We’re doing-- Yeah, okay.
Austin:  Let’s do 40.
Austin: Thirty-five, thirty-six…
Ali: Everyone clap at home!
[cl-cl-clap cl-clap]
Austin: … I think we got it.
Keith: Nope. We didn’t, but.
Ali: Yeah, that’s fine.
Nick: I for-
Austin: Hey internet--
Nick: I forgot to clap, also I’m not recording in Audacity.
Austin: Ugh…
Ali: Oh.
Austin: Start recording!
Nick: ‘Kay.
Keith: Start recording, and then we’ll clap again.
Nick: Now everyone can freak out.
Austin (dryly): Oh. This is the best.
Keith: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Only one more clap.
Art: My clock is twenty-one seconds behind; what’s the matter, clock??
Jack: Yeah, I’ve been on the wrong time for years.
Austin: Mine’s 2.4 - where we at?
Keith: Um, we’re, right now we’re at--
Art: 4, 5, 6.
Austin: Okay. Nick, are we ready to clap, Nick?
Nick: Yes! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Keith: Okay, so let’s do 20. No, 15?
Austin: No, we’re doing-- I believe in us. 
Keith: Ok. 
Austin: I believe in 15.
[clap      clap clap     clap]
Austin: I shouldn’t have believed in us even a little bit.
Art: I was so early!
Keith: Okay! Four claps! 35, guys! We have 15 seconds to prepare. [Ali laughs]
Art: Wait, wait! Everything’s going wrong!
Keith: … Yeah. Everything’s going wrong. Are we-- Can we make 35?
Austin: We can do it.
Dre: Yes.
Art: Yeah, we can make 35.
[clap clap clap clap             (clap)]
`2:54
Austin: Hey, internet. My name’s Austin Walker.
Keith: Hi!
Austin: Welcome to Friends at the Table. It's a, uh, an actual-play podcast on the internet! Where we focus on critical world-building, fun interactions between friends, and a third thing which I've forgotten. Tonight we’re doing our post-mortem--
Keith: You’ve never forgotten that before!
Austin: Well, it’s ‘cause normally I have it on my screen, instead of just time.is. Also, no one on this- no one on the call knows this, but that was perfect, because I was playing Jack’s intro music over it. [intro music fades out] Um. So, we’re here today to do a post-mortem of the, uh, Dungeon World campaign that we’ve been running over the… what do you call it. Months? Almost a year now?
Keith: Yeah, it was-- 
Art: Yeah. 
Keith: We started in September of 2014.
Ali: Oh my god.
Austin: We did. And it is now June of 2015. [crosstalking] We were doing- Like, I was like doing-
Art: For like, a whole school year.
Austin: Right. I was like, doing pre-prep for this campaign at this point last year, for sure. Like, this was like, the little bits of, like, desire to run this had really formed, and I think we were starting to push towards it? And then it took a couple months to get there! But we did! We did it.
Jack: [chuckles]
Keith: Yup.
Austin: Um… So how’s it going, everybody?
Keith: Uh, I deserve an editing medal for the thing that the chat just witnessed, which is basically every week.
[laughter]
Austin: This is the first time we’ve all been together since… the… since ever. Since ever. This is the first time that the entire podcast has been together, um, at once. So I’m pretty happy about that.
Art: Oh, sure.
Jack: It’s gonna be a nightmare.
Austin: It is. 
Jack:  It’s not gonna be a nightmare.
Austin It’s gonna be sad, because the podcast went to some sad places. But I think mostly it went to happy places.
Ali: Well…
Austin: We’re gonna do some- we’re gonna do some-
Art: … What?!
Ali: Yeah, when was anyone happy in this podcast? [laughs] 
Art: What were the happy-- [crosstalk]
Keith: Were we not happy when we-- [crosstalk]
Art: When were we happy?
Jack: I had some brief blissful moments!
Austin: I was happy, as like, the director. Getting good performances out of my players. Uh, yeah--
Dre: I shot a guy in the eye! That was cool. I was happy with that.
Austin: People who don’t know about what happens in this campaign should- should probably, like- should probably...
Jack: Really… listen to the campaign.
Austin: … Really… think about leaving.
Jack: We’ve got some real spoilers.
Austin: This stuff is going to come-- yeah. This is going to come out as a podcast episode; as this week’s episode, presumably?
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: If, if Keith can turn it around. If not, it’ll be fine.
Art: All that clap shit might be hard.
Austin: [chuckles] And so… So, seriously, I, I appreciate you being here and supporting us, but also don’t feel bad about bouncing, um, because we’re definitely gonna get into some, like, serious spoiler territory here.
Nick: Yeah, if all these amazing wonderful people in the chat throwing love at us could just bounce, so I don’t have to look at this and feel… really nervous? That would be great.
Austin: Eh, we’ll be fine.
Jack: We’ll be fantastic.
Austin: So, we have a couple of questions that have been submitted in, over Twitter and, and I think to our email. [stage whispering] Did we check our email?? Ali, did you check our email?
Ali: The questions that I sent you are from our email.
Austin: Okay, good, phew.
[laughter]
Austin: Uh, I also can’t look at the questions that you sent me, because they’re on Skype, and Skype is part of the screen-share. So I just need someone else to… I need… I’ll just pull it up on-- I need someone else to email me the questions, so I can read them off my phone.
Ali: You precious boy. Okay.
Austin: I am a mess. Listen.
Ali: [laughing] I was like, ‘Yeah, I’ll send them to Austin on Skype, so he’ll have them.’
Austin: I can’t look at that, ‘cause…
Jack: You need to send them to Austin via a pigeon!
`6:17
Austin: Yes. Clearly. Um… 
Art: Yeah. 
Austin: But I do… I guess I want to start by talking to you guys as the players, and see like… How… How did that feel? For y’all. [Ali laughing]
Jack: What, everything?
Austin: Yeah!
Ali: Which… [laughing]
Austin: Like, so I know, for some of you, this was the first time you ever did tabletop roleplaying, and I know for some of you, you’ve been doing it for literally forever. So like… What did you guys think? You have a good time?
Jack: Yeah. Definitely. Uh, I was…
Keith: I had a great time!
Art: Eh. It had its moments.
[laughter]
Austin: Great. Good. Good. Thanks.
Keith: I-- Austin, you did such a good job, that even when Ali was murdering the only other character that I liked…[Jack laughs]
Ali: Yeah?
Keith: …I was still having fun.
Austin: Well, that’s good.
Jack: The, um…
Ali: This was, this was the only, um… like, campaign I’ve ever done, and I can’t, like, play any other game with a different GM. Probably.
Austin: Aww. That’s real-- Well, I mean. That’s very sweet, but like, that’s also a thing you say before you’ve had, like, another good GM. Like, there are lots of good GMs out there, I promise. I promise. I haven’t ruined you for other GMs.
Jack: There are all different aspect masters. 
Keith: There are also a lot of really bad GMs out there.
Austin: There are! There are lots of other bad GMs.
Nick: Look, this is not, this is not my first tabletop game by far, and Austin’s still the best GM I’ve ever had. Hands down.
Austin: I do appreciate it, I do really appreciate it. But I do, I kind of want to know what you guys thought about, like, where you thought the campaign would go, from that first session on the boat.
Jack : Yeah. 
Austin: Someone pointed this out a couple of months ago, maybe it was a couple weeks ago, on Twitter, that like that first game was like, us shouting, or you all shouting at each other for thirty minutes about whether or not you would sink on the way from the boat to the shore??
[laughter]
Jack: Yep.
Austin: And-
Art: And it’s yes, right, we would’ve? That would’ve just been it?
[laughter]
Austin: Yeah, that was it! That was the… You guys solved that first crazy puzzle that I put together, and you made it. Oh, God.
Jack: I really liked how… I really liked how--
Nick: Look, the first--
Austin: One at a time. Jack.
Nick: Go ahead; sorry.
Jack: How expansive everything became? But in a way that felt expansive sort of, spatially and narratively at the same time. Um, we stopped worrying about a short stretch of water, and started worrying about whether or not this city was going to get destroyed?
Austin: Right, right.
Jack: But in a way that felt very organic, and not like… Ah, I think it’s just that, like, the quality of the medium, or the nature of the medium, but we could do stuff on that scale, without it feeling like Fallout 3’s Megaton quest? 
Austin: Right. 
Jack: You know, where we were just checking boxes and things.
Austin: Right, like, ‘oh, I don’t know who we are, but we’re gonna hit this button now, and now all these people are going to disappear.’
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: ‘And because I can do that, then they must not really matter all that much.’
Jack: But also, I guess, along with that, it made moments when that did happen quite abruptly really, um, really striking to me. Like when Fantasmo just closes this thing and destroys an entire dimension?
Austin: I loved that moment so much. 
Keith: Yeah, me too. 
Austin: Because that was a moment, Nick, I kind of saw that moment coming. 
Nick: Uh hm. 
Austin: I’ve gone back and listened to that episode a bunch at this p-- well, not ‘a bunch’, but I’ve listened to those moments a bunch, and I can hear in my own voice the moment where I realize you’re going to do that, and I have to come to terms with what that might mean? And I have to like, do like, the weird magic ontology of like, ‘okay. What does it mean to dispel another magical dimension? And like, what’s he gonna roll? Oh. Okay. Yeah, let’s just commit to this! This is interesting.’
[laughter]
`9:55
Austin: One of the reasons I like this game - Dungeon World by, by Adam Koebel and Sage LaTorra - is that it follows in a kind of recent history of tabletop roleplaying games that really encourage you to go with what sounds interesting, and what’s the most, kind of- what is the most compelling possible outcome more than, ‘oh, what the dice say.’ Right? Like, the dice didn’t tell me that you dissolved that dimension. I didn’t check the, the, you know, supplement on magical dimensions, and then, and then index-cross that-
Nick: Right. 
Austin: -you know, cross-index that with what the dispel spell does. It was just like, ‘okay, no, you know, here’s the thing. It dispels things. This play-- oh yeah! Okay, let’s do this, that’s interesting.’ You know? Uh, you were gonna say something else though, Nick. What were you gonna say?
Nick: Oh, um. I was gonna say before, about us, like, arguing about the boat. It, uh- like, that was just, you know. The first season of every show-
Austin: Yes. 
Nick: -all the characters are weird and stiff, and they all, like-- you know, it’s that old TV trope of everyone arguing about the boat, like…
Austin: Right. It feels so much like a pilot episode, in retrospect?
Nick: Yeah.
Austin: Because, like, Throndir isn’t there, so like, one of the major cast members just isn’t there. Right? 
Nick: [laughs] Right. 
Austin: Um, the groups completely changed after that in terms of like, who is where. And just like the… So, that whole… that whole...
Nick: And like, they didn’t even have the dog yet! 
Austin: No dog. 
Nick: It was a cat instead?
Austin: Yeah. [laughter] So that whole different first episode happens in this really interesting vertical space, where it’s like, you’re going up the tower and everything feels really self-contained, and then after that, both parties going to like, horizontal spaces that are just big and open, um, and it’s like, ‘oh, these could just go forever in any direction, fuck.’ And like, that was really scary for me as a GM. 
Nick: Uh hm.
Austin: Because in both cases, y’all went in directions I wasn’t one hundred percent sure you would go in. And, and especially in the boat party case, went in a direction that was completely different than what I had intended, and I just had to like, ‘uhhh okay, well, what’s this whole new adventure gonna be??’ Um, and again, I’m happy that, with Dungeon World, because it let me run with that in a way that I think a lot of systems wouldn’t have.
Ali: Yeah, after, like, knowing what all of the stuff in their tower, I wonder what was supposed to be in ours.
Austin: Yeah! 
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: Good question! I kind of teased this yesterday on, on Skype a little bit. I was just like, ‘man, y’all missed a lot of interesting stuff!’ Like, there was kind of like, Troll Don Quixote was over on that path, and like, David Bowie was definitely over there, and like, neither of those things are lies. I am telling you the truth. Those are things that didn’t happen in your game because--
Keith: Those are two things I would’ve really liked to see.
Austin: Yep.
Ali: It’s fine. We had a good time.
Austin: We did! So, are there any other, like, general thoughts about the characters, or about the world, before we get into questions? Or about the, the scope of the thing, or anything else, really.
`12:43
Jack: Um, someone in the chat pointed out, uh, that… And, we might need this confirmed? But, did the story largely take a swerve because Keith made a joke about ghost pirates?
Austin: Yes. Yes. One hundred percent on boat party’s side. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Um, so yeah. To remind people of that, like, that was-- Well, it’s not just that, right? It-- We can actually trace that further back, right? Like, the first episode, Ali gets a love letter, which is the kind of mechanic where everybody gets to, like, roll a weird thing to kind of do, like, a kind of mechanical flashback? Uh, to do a little bit of like, storytelling? And for her, it was, ‘Oh, you, you were sent by Velas to recover some goods stolen by Brandish, the pirate,’ and, and I think to recover the boat itself. And so, so, Hella and Calhoun went to recover that boat, and on a roll of ten or more, she got three things, and on a roll of seven to nine, she got two things, I think. And the things that she took were like, I think, a telescope, the treasure, and the boat, I think?
Ali: And the map.
Austin: Or, oh no yeah sorry, it was the map, the boat, and like, I think the food that he’d stolen, or something like that. So one of the things you didn’t take was Brandish’s head. And I remember… later in that episode - not that episode, but the first episode where you guys were on the boat after convincing Calhoun to drag the party onto the boat, uh…
Keith: The boat that I said we should not go on.
Jack: Yes.
Austin: Right. You failed a navigational roll - someone failed a navigational roll - and it was like, ‘well, what could I do to offer this, to offer you a hard bargain?’ And the hard bargain was like, you can kind of run yourself at the risk of running up against the rocks, or you could run into the trouble of the pirates. Um, and y’all were so confident! Y’all were like--
Ali: Well--
Austin: -- Ali! Ali especially was like, ‘Listen, Hella already beat this dude ~once~, so…’ [laughter] And then… So that was another point at which you could’ve avoided that whole arc of the game, right? And then, Keith was like, ‘well, what do they look like; are they… are they zombie pirates,’ basically. Because, like. ‘Hella didn’t get his head, but does that mean she mi-- almost got his head? Like is his head almost off?’ And like, ‘oh, yeah. Yep. Uh-huh! That.’ And again, like, Dungeon World is a game which lets me just do that, which is really dope, so… [happy sigh]
Jack: Yeah. And I think wo--
Art: So you’re saying hubris was an important theme in both games.
[0:15:00]
Austin: Hubris was a-- hubris is maybe the most important theme of this whole game. Right? Like, now that I think about it, between Hadrian and Fantasmo, and Hella, and Calhoun, and some of the stuff with Samothes and Samot, it’s like, hubris again and again and again and again from top to bottom. Which isn’t intentional. Like, I didn’t sit down and say, ‘oh, this is going to be a game about, about hubris,’ right? But like, some of the, the high points again and again are the moments that, that fuck with that, right? It’s- it’s Throndir at the, the council, um, kind of being chastised for being off on his own and thinking he knows better than the council elders. It’s- it’s, uh, Fantasmo, whispering the word to the Word Eater. That moment is, is real high, uh, on, on the hubris theme. Right? 
Nick: Mm.
Austin: Like, in that, in that it was him finally ceding a little bit of it, and having to find a little bit of humility. Um. So… Seer, Seer235 in the chat says, ‘Fantasmo means hubris in Elven.’ That’s right.
[laughter]
Jack: Um, and I think--
Dre: I think, uh-- Oh, go ahead, Jack, sorry.
Jack: Oh, I was just gonna say that, um. Keith and I talk about this a lot. That whole aspects of 
Lem and Emmanuel are entirely conjectural?
Austin: Mm-hmm.
Ali: [laughing]
Jack: Um, conjectural from the point of view of Lem, who basically… essentially passes someone in the street, at first, and then just goes like, ‘Oh man, they look like a sort of person.’ Um, and then thinks about it for like, weeks. And then just keeps bumping into them again.
Dre: [laughing]
Austin: Yep! Yep.
Jack: And obviously as the show went along, there- there became more and more solid stuff there between them? But I-- it is very funny to me that, um- that we just sort of made up-- or, Lem just made up a relationship with a person, that didn’t exist at all.
Austin: Yeah, that was-- The relationships between the characters, I think, it definitely… may be the most interesting bits of this game? Um, for me as a GM, um, but also as a listener. Right? Like, there was a certain sort… There are lots of pairings in this game? Um, oppositional and, and, um, you know, in, in allegiance, sort of? Right, like - the Lem-Fero relationship gets, starts off super strong, and then gets really strained. The Hadrian-Fantasmo one-- In some ways, they’re on the same side because they’re both authority figures in a group of ragtag, you know, ridiculous… I don’t even know what you are. Um, and so both of them in that first session were very much like, ‘no, let’s just like, keep it together and move forward.’ But also just like, deep deep deep rivals who don’t like each other very much.
Jack: [laughing]
Nick: Right.
Austin: Um… Again, Hella and Hadrian, same sort of thing, right? Like, ‘what here is evil’, uh, meets… meets like, the person who, who, you know, deeply-- Hadrian deeply believes that even though Hella is evil, that there is something worth saving there. Which is really, really great, even though the two of you were not in the same game for the majority of the season, right. Uh.
Jack: And Hadrian cannot suffer an evil thing to live.
Austin: Right! Right, also literally, that is his thing. [laughing] Um… I’m looking at the questions now; I’m trying to decide what the fir-- Okay, here’s the first question. Uh--
Nick: Oh, wait. I had a thing about Lem and Fero, quick.
Austin: Sure.
Nick: This is a… jokey thing, because that’s me. But, um. I, I figured out the confusion. I figured it out the confusion between the names.
Austin: Uh-huh?
Nick: I know why that happens all the time.
Austin: Yeah?
Nick: Because, uh. Fero is a small little, uh, fuzzy nature boy, that often rushes headlong into things without thinking about it… much like a lemming would do.
Austin: Ahh.
Jack: Oh nooo~! [laughing]
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. That’s it. That’s it. That makes perfect sense.
Nick: So everyone wants to call him ‘Lem’, because…
Austin: Right, cause he’s a little…
Nick: Okay, that’s it.
Keith: Cause I’m a lemming.
`18:45
Austin: Alright. So let’s start with this one, which is, “What themes or ideas were the initial building blocks for this world or campaign? If there was no theme at conception, or if there was, did any themes emerge that you, Austin, but mainly- mainly, but also everyone latched onto and wanted to start steering towards? How did your plans change from that first concept episode until now?” I think we’ve kind of handled most of that question? But I do want to give some of what… You know, that first actual world-building episode covers a lot of that, right? Like, the thing that, that, when I was talking to Jack, uh, about the- the music for the game, and when I- when I talked to Craig, who did our wonderful art, uh, who is- who Nick put us in touch with, and when I talked to everybody, really, I said like, ‘Here are the themes: Autumn, not winter,’ right? 
Like, this, this moment of- of this fear about what could come next. Um, and, on top of that, this kind of like, moment of recovery, after something really hard. The game was meant to be a kind of post-post-apocalyptic, post-fantasy, post-Tolkien, by which I always meant, like - it’s not anti those things. It’s not opposed to fantasy in and of itself … Even though, on my, like, my meanest days, I kind of am? Um, it was always meant to be like, “well, what, what here is salvageable? What here can we work with? What here-- What does the stuff look like, once it’s been freed of its… kind of, the chains of nerd-dom, and nostalgia, and fandom, and history? What do orcs look like, when you get rid of the Battle at Helm’s Deep?’ Without the Battle at Helm's Deep,  without needing that scene, what can orcs look like? 
And I think we did a pretty good job of answering those sorts of questions, and I think most of the characters fell into that role- that question nicely, too, which is ‘who is it that I want to be in this world? Who is it that-? With ev- with all of the history behind me that I can like, decide do I want to be this person or this person.’ And I tried my best to make those the kind of the linchpins of the major like, arcs- the major big- big episodic moments. As I think everyone knows at this point. [Austin and Jack laugh] Were there are any other major themes or building block stuff that- that I’ve forgotten... other than like imagine Wes Anderson did fantasy? [laughter]
Jack: Well, I think that’s- what was interesting to me is when you read that question out-
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: -um, in my head, I was just going like, ‘yep yep yep’ because like in a very literal sense, you gave us a list.
Austin: Mhm.
Jack: And that was- the fact that- that you gave us the list and then just went down and like, succeeded in all those things-
Austin: Right.
Jack: -is super cool to me because I don't know. When I'm writing writing, I don't like thinking about like, ‘oh here are the themes and now I'm going to write a story.’ Um, but here it worked super well. And I liked that a lot. 
Austin: I think it worked. I think it worked. I actually just realized I cut this person's question off. The other half is a mechanical one mostly. And this is from- from Michael Yanos, and he also asks- he says he's super curious to know what my notes looked like. ‘Like nitty-gritty details- how are my notes structured when I first set out to write say the layout of Nacre and its points of interest? What words do I need to be looking at when introducing a new NPC?’ For me, like  Nacre I did- I drew out in Roll20 after writing out a list of what I thought were some interesting places, and I just kind of like, organically went for it. 
But in general, my notes are like- my notes look like, an eleventh grader’s outline [light laugh] of like, a lecture in class. Like ‘A’ Nacre. Here's- you know, here's some stuff in Nacre, and then it goes down that way. And I also end up structuring stuff on- basically, I had different documents for each of the sub games and then a big document for the main games and then a big document of all of what Dungeon World calls fronts, which are the different factions in the game. And I just kind of had to keep a lot of those open at once. I was a mess at note keeping honestly. I kept a ton of notes. I did a ton of prep, but it was not clean, and it was not easy to manage. 
Art: And of course these notes will all be available in the special collector's edition of season one of Friends at the Table.
Austin: Right. Yep.[Ali and Jack laugh] Available now. 1-800-streamfriends. A quick  question from the chat from ATI- or Adam Ody who says ‘did Austin keep OBS-ing all the sessions? Will we ever get to see the Roll20 board in motion? It'd be so good on YouTube.’ I do have all those files. I haven't deleted them yet so one day you'll get to see the chickens. [Ali and Jack laugh]
Jack: That was the funniest.
Austin: That's like, the number one thing for me. That and like, the moment in the tower where suddenly people were just drawing a weird little man on the side. I don’t know who did it. 
Keith: That was me.I drew that man. 
Austin: Who’s that little man? 
Keith: I drew that man. 
Jack: Aw, that was pretty good. 
Austin: You want to do a chat question? Would someone pick a question from the chat? 
Nick: Charlie Dart asks, ‘what here is evil?’ [Ali laughs]
Austin: Good question. Especially given the end of the last- the- the end of the last session. In fact, I'll read this question for you all. This is from Jasmine who says, ‘my question is mostly -quote- Do any of the characters having heard how shit went down after High Sunday wish they had gone with the other group?’ 
Ali: Yep. [Jack laughs]
Austin: And in general, I'm just curious to think about like, what do you- what do you guys think your character would have been like if you'd been on the other side of the party? 
Keith: Well, Calhoun would still be dead. 
Austin: Maybe I don't- you don't know that. 
Ali: No… [laughs] I think um, Hella for sure wishes that she did not go on that boat trip and was instead like, supporting Hadrian after he had this awful time. 
Art: Sure, but by the same token like, Hadrian wishes he didn't have this awful time.
Ali: Yeah. 
Art: Though like, I don't think he would have much better at like, a big trial. Like I think that would have been an equally distressing moment for him. 
Ali: Yeah 
Dre: Would that have even happened if Hadrian was there? Cause there's no way that Hadrian gives up Calhoun to pirates. 
Austin: That's probably true. 
Jack: Aw, but we like- 
Ali: Yeah, that’s the weird thing. 
Art: That’s probably true.
Ali: Hella’s like, the weirdo leader of the boat party crew.
Jack: Oh definitely. [Ali laughs] Like, absolutely. 
Ali: Like, Lem and Fero keeping looking to her for answers, and she's like, ‘I don't know. I'm just like- we could beat them up, I guess?’ [Dre and Nick laugh] 
Jack: Which I don’t know- even if that's an answer that Lem and Fero are looking for, but they still keep looking to Hella for that answer. [Ali laughs] And I like that a lot. 
Austin: It's like a bad habit. It really is. 
Jack: Right, yeah. Exactly. Just like, ‘oh, what's- what’s Hella gonna do? Well- well, we'll do what she's doing. Oh, killing people? Oh… oh fuck.’ [Austin and Dre laugh] 
Art: And this might sound like too- too like, fatalistic, but like I sort of feel like Hadrian would have found what he found no matter where he went. 
Austin: That's probably true. 
Jack: Uh hm. 
Austin: Like not- and I don't mean that as a- There are things... Maybe that's not true. Like I didn't rig it so that you would find Samothese or Samot rather. 
Art: Sure.
Austin: Like I didn't- I didn't like- I wouldn't have just put him in the other place if you had gone to the other place. You would have met a different character, but- but one that would have also challenged Hadrian's belief in Samothese as like, the one true, one only god. So, it would have been a different challenge certainly. It wouldn't have been like this boyish… you know, king. It would have been something else. Which could have been really interesting, too. And you know as- we might get there next time in the future. 
Art: It would have been a girlish king. A... 
Austin: [laughs] Yes, exactly. Anybody else on that question? Both- both like, what have you- would you like to have gone in the other direction?
Jack: Oh, I think-
Austin: And also like, where are- where do you- where do you see your characters at after High Sunday, as the kind of-?
Art: Holy shit. [Ali and Nick laugh]
Austin: Let's come back to Art. Let's give Art some time. [Nick laughs] 
Jack: I think as well- Like um, there was a lot of like, Uklan Tel and Sunder, as characters, were definitely people that I think Lem would have liked to have met. In the same way that Lem had a sort of paralyzing fear and at the same time respect for Morbash. I think that’ve been- that’ve definitely have been a level of like, ‘oh hey, real archivists.’ [Austin and Jack laugh] In the same way that when I go and see like, a professor at school, I definitely feel like, ‘Oh hey. This- this person is like me, but they know loads and loads of stuff.’ [Austin, Ali, and Dre laugh] Um, and uh- cause like, Lem’s.. I think Lem is pretty young for an orc, right? Like he's- Uklan Tel is definitely significantly older than him, at least in my mind.
Austin: I think so. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Jack: In that whole scene and especially with the- the parallel universe orc place, I think Lem would definitely have taken a different level of- A lot of Lem’s satisfaction in Nacre was quite selfish, I think.
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: I think it was him going like, ‘Oh man, look at all- look at all this stuff!’ But I think there’d have been definitely something more academic had he been in the tower and had he been in the presence of other people who you know, like to do his job, but better. 
Austin: Knew- Right, right. He would have done differently? He would have been a different…?
Jack: Yeah, also he'd probably have been arrested, but you know. 
Austin: Yes. True. [Nick laughs] Who else? Art, are you ready to talk about-?
Nick: Uh, I think- 
Austin: Or- go ahead- go ahead, Nick.
Nick: Oh, I think Fantasmo would have been exactly the same. [Ali laughs] 
Austin: Yeah? If he'd gone in boat party?
Nick: He- he would have- he would have found ways to alienate everyone around him and be a selfish, old asshole-
Austin: No matter what. 
Dre: Eh. 
Nick: Uh, no matter- no matter what. He would find ways. [Jack laughs] But also-
Dre: We’d be elf friends forever, Nick. There's no- there's no alienating Throndir. [Nick laughs] He just needs love and attention from anyone. 
Austin: [laughs lightly] Aw. 
Nick: Aw. Well, okay. Then I guess he would have had one less pal.
Austin: Right? See that's- that who-
Nick: He would have had no friends.
Austin: You would have had- Well, who knows? Who knows really? 
Dre: Yeah. 
Nick: But also I have no- I literally have no idea where Fantasmo even is right now.
Austin: Is. Right. Well,  that's one of the big-
Nick: Like-
Austin: That's- that is a big question especially going into- Especially after some of the Disciples a Fantasmo stuff that kind of came up at the last-
Nick: Yeah.
Austin: -few sessions, and so- so who knows? 
Jack: Yeah, Fantasmo’s in a place
Austin: [quietly] Fantasmo’s in a place. 
Nick: Huh?
Austin: Art, are you ready to talk a little bit about…? You still need some time? Do you want me to talk to Andrew and see what Andrew is up to? [Ali laughs] 
Art: I mean if you- if you wanna. I- I've been thinking about it a lot today just because listening to the end of- I didn’t listen to the end of boat party until today-
Austin: Right. 
Art: -so I was kind of like, thinking about endings again. But like, I realize like, I don't even know what I think like, Hadrian looks like in the next episode of-
Austin: Right.
Art: -of our thing. Like- like I literally like, don't know what clothes he would be wearing or what he would like, be like. It's- it's all very like- it's- it's a very shaking- it's a very fragile point for Hadrian, and I don't- I don't know that that’s- that that’s good or safe.
[0:30:00]
Austin: Right.
Art: Because like- cause- because I feel like the safe place for Hadrian is- is a violent place.
Austin: And that- and that- The thing that justified his violence has kind of been shooken a little bit, right? Like- like he spent a long time being violent and being- and having that violence is justified because he was doing the will of Samothes. And like-
Art: Right. 
Austin: -with that- With that will- will kind of either in doubt, in the sense like, is he really willing me to do this? Or in doubt in like, do I really want to be doing this? That's extra- 
Art: Right.
Austin: I can see that being extra weird. 
Art: And like-and does- does he want to be- does he want me to be doing this anymore? Like in a- in a really strong way I like, failed at High Sunday. 
Austin: Yeah? You've come around in thinking that killing Jericho was a failure? [Jack laughs] Because I remember at the time you basically defended it up and down. 
Ali: [overlapped] I think he’s defending it up and down.
Art: Uh, I don’t think killing Jericho is a failure. That was absolutely the right choice to make. He was gonna be vaporized in like, 10 minutes because like- Unlike some other people, I’m not just lettin’ murderers go free [louder] like everyone else did. [Dre and Jack laugh] And uh, but I mean that I really-
Ali: We’re all murderers.
Art: I really failed the church, right? Like that- that episode for Hadrian ends with his ring falling off his finger. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Keith: I want to know- [clears throat] because it seems like um- it seems like there's- there's some sort of- kind of connection now between Hadrian and Hella. But if Hadrian's not the kind of person who's letting murderers go free... 
Dre: Are you- 
Keith: [Ali laughs quietly] What I'm asking is are you gonna strangle Hella to death? [Austin, Ali, and Dre laugh]
Art: Point of order. I didn't strangle anyone to death. I snapped Jericho's neck. 
Keith: Oh, right.
Ali: I did the strangling. Please, Keith.
Keith: Right, yeah. 
Art:  And second most importantly, Hadrian is most importantly a lawful man, and I believe Hella was acquitted. [Everyone laughs hard] 
Austin: He’s not wrong. He’s not wrong.
Keith: But you didn’t even give- you didn’t even give the dude a chance to be acquitted. You just let him get- you just let him get stabbed in the neck by you. 
Ali: Those ladies with the hats would have done it anyway. It’s fine. 
Keith: They might not have. 
Art: Yeah, those ladies with the hats would have done it. Oh yeah, they would have. 
Austin: They would have.
Jack: Those ladies with the hats… they’re… a thing. 
Austin: They're just out there now. They're just out there.
Jack: Yeah.
Keith: Yeah.  
Ali: Yeah.
Austin: I have a vague idea of where they are. I’ll have to think about a lot. I kind of have an idea. 
Jack: I'm very interested by them, at least partly in the sort of… um, the new Assassin's Creed game sense of I think they have guns? [Austin laughs] Do they have guns? [Ali and Keith laugh] 
Austin: Right, right. Yes. [Nick laughs]
Jack: What are guns gonna do in this world?
Austin: Yeah, yeah. Related to this- 
Jack: But they also seem pretty cool. 
Ali: What are-?
Austin: What were you gonna say? 
Ali: What do I have… for Hella to join them?
Austin: It’s a lot. It's probably a lot. I- You know. [Jack laughs] There's definitely tests. There's definitely like, some weird magic shit. 
Nick: Wait. 
Austin: I don't know- I don’t know.
Jack: You need a hat. 
Nick: Which ladies in the hats?
Austin: From the- 
Nick: Was this-?
Austin: -the holiday session.
Ali: Uh huh. 
Austin: The ladies-
Nick: Oh!
Austin: The like- the not Sherlock Holmes and Watson-
Nick: Yeah, what were they?
[simultaneously]
Dre: Yeah, the golden Lance 
Jack: The golden-
Austin: The order of the Golden Lance. The order of the Golden Lance.
Nick: Yes.
Austin: Victoria Lake? And…
Nick: Yes.
Austin: Fuck, what was the other one’s name? 
Nick: The whole time I was listening to that, I really-
Art: Victoria Lake is definitely a children’s mystery series. [Austin laughs]
Nick: I- I really, really wanted like, an anime based on their adventures. 
Austin: Oh yeah. They are like super-
Nick: Solomon and Lake. 
Austin: Solomon, yes. I forget what her first name is. Was it Gloria Solomon?
Nick: Solomon and Lake, of the Golden Lance. 
Austin: Maybe something like that. 
Nick: Yeah.
Austin: Yeah, they're fantastic.
Nick: Yep.
Austin: Related to this, Sylvia Clare, in the chat, says- asks ‘So I, The Grand Meme, have an actual serious question. Like any tabletop game, you guys had a ton of emergent mythology happening, and I'm just curious that- what you guys as players are- about what you guys as players are really hoping to learn more about/flesh out more the next season of play.’ So like, two things for me. One, I'm like endlessly more interested in just developing the fringes of something new and then really only doing a deep dive when it feels like a player wants to do a deep dive. I… you know, I- you know, I don't know if people follow like, Jack and I on Twitter, but sometimes he and I just like, throw out the titles of things that would be interesting. Because that's enough for me to be like, ‘ooh.’ 
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: It's one of the reasons where like, I can stand Ddestiny's fiction because it doesn't give you deep lore and only gives you tastes of things. That said there are a few things that I- I obviously spent a lot of time working out the lore for like, the different- the kind of different variations on- on Samothes and- and that whole kind of- that whole collection of gods, but what about you guys? Is there anything that we didn't get deep into this- this season that you'd like to next season? 
Nick: The- the Last University.
Austin: Uh hm. I think we'll get there. 
Nick: Okay. I want to know about- more about what happened in the final days and- and-
Austin: Other people?
Nick: So, I can figure out what Fantasmo’s part in it was-
Austin: Right, right. 
Nick: -if anything. 
Dre: Uh-
Jack: It was definitely us in- 
Dre: Oh. 
Jack: No go on. 
Dre: Jack and I keep talking at the same time, sorry.
Jack: I’m sorry, Dre. 
Dre: I’m- we had kind of talked about this from just a mechanic's standpoint, Austin, where I wanted to take- there's a ranger talent that lets you get more like pre-spells.
Austin: Uh hm. Uh hm. 
Dre: And we decided not to just because that would be like, two priests in the party between me and Hadrian. But I am interested in kind of seeing- building more upon this weird connection that Throndir now has to this dead, demigod person.
Austin: Uh hm. 
Dre: And seeing where that goes kind of mechanically in character development wise.
Austin: Right. Yeah, totally. Jack? 
Jack: Uh-
Art: I'd like to see the goblin rebellion- Oh. [Austin, Ali, and Jack laugh] I- I forgot about Jack.
Austin: That's just because- that's just because you want Auniq burnt to the ground, right? 
Jack: Well, that’s a fair thing to want. 
Art: Yeah, I think they need some help, and I can help. [Austin, Jack, and Nick laugh]
Dre: Yeah, that’s fair. 
Jack: Aw, that's a good moment. Um, I'm very- there was some stuff in the holiday special about the actual moment to moment ground-level workings of Hadrian's Church and faith, as opposed to this sort of philosophical belief based stuff… um, the stuff in the church at the holiday episode was really interesting to me.
Nick: Oh yeah. Yeah, definitely.
Jack: And I'd be interested to- like, a lot of the first season is about grand powers and grand machinations, although very often that comes from a much, much smaller acorn, I guess. And there are definitely aspects of those grand powers and grand machinations that I'm- that I'm interested in. I'm interested in what- what was the mood like on the Ordennan ships sailing for Nacre? You know, what is happening at the ground level during these big moments?
Austin: Right, like- Especially now that you understand that they were doing that hot off the heels of conquering Nacre, right?
Jack: Right. Totally, yeah. 
Austin: Or sorry- when they were on the- on the- Sorry in- during the High Sun game- High Sun Day game, where they were parked outside of Velas.
Jack: Yeah.
Austin: Right? Which is again really weird. 
Jack: Um, and that's super interesting. Also just the idea that the Ordennans know about this place. Or at least know about it enough to, you know, mount an invasion on it. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: Cause it's such a mystery to the rest of us before we found it. 
Austin: Yeah, totally. Absolutely. 
Ali: Yeah, I'm curious like, who there knows it and like, what sort of-
Jack: How does that work?
Ali: - what the agreement there was.
Austin: Right. 
Ali: And then there's- [sighs] 
Austin: No, there’s a lot. 
Ali: The whole like, Ordennan army and like, what’s going on with that map?
Austin: Yeah, someone asked- someone asked earlier what would have happened if the pirate stuff hadn't driven you guys into Nacre. If you had gone the other way, I was ready to give you the Ordennan game of like, seeing what the life in an Ordennan fort is like. And it wouldn't have been- [someone says; ‘Ooo’] a big long game the way the Nacre stuff was, it would have just been a pit stop on the way south towards the tower that you were supposed to go to. Um... [Jack laughs] Which I’m not hanging that over your heads at this point. Like it's- it's done. [laughs] It’s done now. 
Ali: Yeah, I remember being like, a decision, but I- like, it was my decision to make because Hella was at the helm, and I didn't want to be like, ‘oh, let's make this Hella’s game.’ 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: That's why I guess I did that. It’s fine. [laughs] 
Austin: Quick question. 
Nick: But that’s why you're the good- that's why you're the good GM, Austin, because [Austin laughs] like, I've had GMs in the past that like, you know, you're teasing us with David Bowie, but-
Austin: Right, right. I am teasing.
Nick: I have had a DM in the past that was always really salty-
Austin: Right. 
Nick: -whenever we took him off of whatever exact meticulous thing that he had planned-
Austin: Right. Well no, like, I said this at the time- 
Nick: -and would remind us like, so many times.
Austin: You know, I reminded- I reminded I think boat party a lot at the time because it felt like- because I wanted to sell the notion that committing to saving Calhoun was a commitment. It isn't like, Skyrim where this is a side quest and the main quest is going to wait up for you. Everything is the main quest. 
Nick: Sure 
Austin: If that makes sense, but at the same time, I was really grateful that the game pushed in that direction because it forced me to develop a whole new city that was- that I could tell immediately was really interesting. Like I said this in the first episode-
Nick: Yeah.  
Austin: -where- where they went into Nacre where- when at the- So, the end of the episode where Brandish takes Calhoun was a really rough episode because it was the first time that it felt like we were trying to figure out what it meant that Hella was evil. And that was like, a tough conversation. Real talk. Because it's like- because like, as a GM it's like, ‘okay, I have to push my player to not just be having quote-unquote fun and to be challenging what she- what Ali- you know, how she was playing and stuff.’ And that was like a tough conversation to figure out what she wanted.
Nick: Hm.
Austin: But we ended up like working through that, and then the whole thing ended up becoming the fuel for an amazing second half of that campaign.
Nick: Yeah, totally.
Ali: Yeah, I remember like, talking to you after that and being like, ‘That was-  that was kind of weird. I didn’t feel great about that.’
Austin: Yeah, yeah. 
Ali: But then like, we discussed it, and I was like, ‘okay, I need to like- Hella is this like, giant piece of ice that I just need to keep carving down.’
Austin: Right, right. 
Ali: And I think I found a place where like, Hella as evil is such a specific thing that I'm trying to play now.
Austin: Yes. 
Ali: And it was good to like, sort of be like, ‘oh, I feel like I've made a mistake on that one part,’ but now like, because of that-
Austin: Right 
Ali: -I know what direction I want to go in the rest of this. 
Austin: Um, yes.
Nick: As a- as a listener of that stuff, I like- it would have been totally different without Nacre.
Ali: And uh-
Austin: Yeah, yeah. I mean, I still think- I mean, that game-
Nick: And it may have been- it was probably gonna be just as good, but I'm glad- I am so glad Nacre existed. 
Austin: That was- No, that was definitely like, one of the- Figuring out Nacre was one of the high points of me as GM- like me, GM-ing. It felt great to figure that stuff out and to be pushed to figure that out. Because it ended- the end of that one session didn't just push me to answer that, but also to like, ‘why the fuck is there an undead pirate?’ Like what- [Ali laughs] 
Nick: Yeah. [laughs] 
Austin: Like, in the same way that I don't want there to be Helms Deep just because orcs are evil-
Nick: Right. 
Austin: -I don't just want undead pirates being evil cause they'retheir undead. Like that's kind of boring, right? 
Nick: Uh hm. 
Austin: Like that they- they have to exist in some ecology somewhere.
Art: Austin, they're evil cause they're pirates. Pirates are bad guys. [Jack laughs] 
Austin: That’s not how it works. 
Jack: Well, no cause the thing about Brandish, as well is Brandish has done some pretty terrible things. 
Keith: Hold on. Pirates are kind of bad guys though. 
Austin: Only sometimes. 
Jack: But like, Brandish has-
Ali: Wait, but Brandish had like, a reason. 
Keith: Pirates, I mean-
Jack: Yeah, this is thing- 
Austin: Jack. 
Jack: Brandish has done some pretty terrible stuff. But Hadrian broke that man's neck and Hella killed everybody. [Ali laughs] 
Austin: Right.
Jack: So I have a degree of-
Art: Hadrian broke a murderer’s neck. 
Jack: I don't know if Lem does cause I don't know if Lem thinks this way, but I have a degree of sympathy almost for Brandish in that or at least- no, I guess more like narrative interest-
Austin: Right. 
Jack: -in that Brandish was introduced as a monster. He was just a monster, at least to our eyes initially. He arrived. He holds his throat closed to talk. 
Austin: Right. 
Jack: He gets thrown off boats and climbs back onto the side again. And then, as soon as we arrived in Nacre, we kind of realize that he's just running supply and logistics jobs for an incredibly, incredibly difficult boss. 
Austin: [laughs] Right, that’s it. Yes. 
Jack: And that's amazing to me. 
Austin: Yeah, and like those- those jobs-
Jack: [overlapped] Ah, and he’s got the best shipmate. 
Austin:  -those jobs are like killing people and stealing their food, but like, they gotta eat. 
Jack: But he's also just stealing their food so that everybody in the city can eat food. 
Austin: Right. All of the humans. 
Keith: I mean, but that's just what piracy is. 
Austin: Yeah. Yep. 
Keith: Pri- privateering, I guess. He's a privateer.
Austin: Right, he's not a criminal in his state. 
Keith: Right, yeah.
Austin: Let's do a fun one. Let's do a fun one. This is from autumn. ‘If your characters are in the modern day what would they be doing?’ 
Keith: Texting, probably. [Austin and Ali laugh]
Austin: Yeah, yep. Fero would be texting a lot. 
Jack: Pinterest. [Nick laughs]
Austin: Yeah, that sounds right. That sounds right. [Nick laughs again] 
Art: Yeah,
Nick: Fantasmo would be a very sad adjunct somewhere. 
Austin: Uh hm. Also-
Keith: Sadjunct. 
Dre: Sadjunct.
Nick: What's that?
Keith: A sadjunct. 
Nick: [laughs] Sadjunct. 
Dre: Jesus Christ. Uhh.. Summer camp counselor. [Ali laughs]
Austin: Yup. That’s it. That’s the one. [Jack and Nick laugh]
Art: I have an answer that realize is wrong, so I need to think of a new and better answer. 
Ali: I don’t know, Hella would be a jerk somewhere. 
Austin: Yeah? 
Ali: Yeah. [laughs] I keep wanting to say like- I don't know. Like MMA fighter? I don't know. [laughs] 
Austin: I'd- 
Ali: She'd be fine. 
Austin: The thing with Hella that's interesting is so much of who she is reflects Ordenna as a place, and like Ordenna as a place- [clears throat] excuse me- doesn't super exist in North America anymore. In that it's like, this industrial power, right? 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: And so like, if Hella is in America right now, man like, she is in like a- she's in like, an old Rust Belt city that used to be hot.
Jack: Detroit? Or-
Austin: She's in a Detroit, you know? Yeah. And like, whoof. 
Jack: That works. 
Austin: Sylvia Clare has a different- has a different suggestion. ‘Hella would be a pro-wrestler. [Ali laughs] And she’d be the dopest heel. She'd be lady Brock Lesnar.’ Okay, that's the other one. [Jack laughs] Yup. 
[0:45:00]
Dre: Yeah. 
Ali: She would be- 
Jack: Hella is such a heel. 
Ali: She would be currently high-fiving Kevin Owens in this moment. [Austin laughs]
Austin: Yep. Uh who else? Do we- do we- do we have an-? Art hasn't submitted one yet. Art? What’s up with Hadrian?
Art: I mean my- my knee-jerk response was that Hadrian would be blowing up abortion clinics. [Austin grunts; Ali laughs] But I don't think that's right.
Nick: Woof.
Ali: [laughs] Buddy.
Dre: [laughing] Jesus Christ! 
Austin: That went dark. 
Art: I mean it's what violent religious people in the suburbs find to do.
Austin: That is- They’re the worst.
Art: But- but I don't think- but like, that is- that is-
Austin: But that's not Hadrian, right? That's the whole thing.
Art: That’s not Hadrian. 
Austin: No. 
Art: Yeah. I don’t know who that is. Like-
Austin: Woof.  
Art: [laughs] Yeah, sorry. I- I didn’t want to-
Ali: Well, Hadrian-
Keith: You could you just be a- you could just be like, a bad dad. Like a- like a super conservative dad.
Austin: Seer- Seer235 says ‘tea party congressman.’ Which I think is the same bit, but just a little scaled down. 
Ali: I think Hadrian would be setting up like- 
Art: I’m not sure he has the political acumen. 
Ali: [laughs] He’d be setting up those Twitter bots that are like, ‘ See why I faved this?’ that links to like, a Jesus website. [Nick laughs] 
Jack: Oh, he would, wouldn’t he? [Dre laughs]
Art: Yeah. Oh yeah. 
Austin: Sylvia- Sylvia says, and this is probably solid, ‘Hadrian would just be like, a cop.’
Art: Sure.
Austin:  I could see that. The authority- you know-
Art: Yeah. 
Dre: Yeah. Probably. 
Austin: Promotion to law and order.
Nick: Yeah 
Austin: Hadrian would be very into respectability politics. [Jack laughs]
Art: He’d be super into respectability politics. [laughs]
Jack: Oh, I think-
Nick: He'd be a cop that was- that was very, very active in the local church.
Austin: Yes.
Nick: Like to the point of like, kind of annoying the- the pastor or the father whoever was the actual leader. [laughs] 
Austin: Oh, right. Right. [pause] Jack, you were saying you think-?
Nick: Like yes, Hadrian, you can do the reading this week. 
Ali: [laughs] Wow. 
Jack: Oh, I was just gonna say-
Art: Everyone else does it badly. [Nick and Dre laugh]
Jack: I'm so, so happy with- with the way Hella’s story turned out-
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: -as an arc, I think is just fantastic. And you were talking about that rough episode where you and Ali were working out what it meant for Hella to be evil, and I think a lot of why I like Hella’s arc so much came from the outcome of those discussions, I guess. 
Austin: Right.
Jack: In that Hella in Nacre, a city that initially seems to be defined by incredible levels of granular detail...
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: It's got hotels. It's got open street markets. It's got like, copper roofs and fancy tiling and everything. Um, eventually just slotted together so perfectly and nicely with this really kind of sad story of a woman who makes a lot of decisions and then has to live with them. [Ali laughs]
Austin: Right. Right. 
Jack: And I- I really like that.
Austin: Yeah. I was a big fan of that. So that- that actually works really well because it sounds like you just answered this question from- from Daniel Moore, who also sent us a bunch of heart emoticons. 
Jack: Thanks. 
Austin: Daniel says, ‘what was each of your favorite bits of season one, and as a group could you decide on a single favorite moment?’ 
Keith: Bits like things? Or bits like jokes? 
Austin: Oh boy. [Ali laughs] Both. Let’s do both. 
Art: So no, we can't. 
Austin: So no, we can never agree. Right. [Jack laughs] 
Nick: My favorite bit-like joke was this- 
Jack: The chicken bit was my favorite joke.
Nick: Okay yeah, that's really good. My favorite bit-like jokes was the Sting jokes. 
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: That’s solid. [Dre laughs]
Keith: Yeah, that’s solid. 
Austin: That’s a solid intro. 
Keith: Those are solid jokes. I really like the- the... What- it’s like, the first four episodes had three separate ‘you guys can't clap on beat’ jokes. Those are really fun.
Austin: Uh hm. 
Keith: There was uh….
Art: I like the Ron jokes a lot.
Keith: Oh, the Ron joke was really fun. 
Austin: [laughs] Beep! Beep!
Ali: Mmm. [Ali and Dre laugh] 
Austin: He started tweeting at me ever since I got this job, by the way. 
Ali: Oh, of course he did. Fuck him.
Art: Yeah, how weird is that? 
Austin: Yeah, weird. [Austin and Jack laugh] Does he still have you blocked, Ali? 
Ali: He still has me blocked, and I don’t know why. [Ali laughs] Fuck him. 
Jack: Ron, if you’re here, hi. Hello. 
Austin: I'm sure you're very nice right now and great, but you were kind of a jerk during college sometimes. There's a motorcycle outside, I'm sorry.
[crosstalking]
Keith: Um-
Dre: Oh, uh Deepflawed says-
Keith: I think- I think one of my-
Dre: Oh, go ahead Keith, sorry.
Keith: Oh, no. You can go. 
Dre: Deepflawed brings up the time learning that time.is existed. 
Austin: Oh that's like- yeah, that's a high point. [Jack laughs] 
Dre: Uh hm. 
Ali: Uh hm. [Nick laughs]
Austin: The moment that Jack realizes that time.is is a real thing is so-
Ali: We had a whole conversation that it existed. [laughs]
Keith: Oh, that’s great. 
Austin: -fuckin’ good. 
Keith: Yep. 
Austin: It’s so good. [Dre laughs] I want to listen to that right now. I wish I just had it to listen to.
Ali: Uh, behind the scenes like, little moment there is that when Keith initially edited that he put in a record scratch right before Jack realized that it existed. [everyone laughs] That was- [laughs] It was truly chef kiss.
Nick: Oh also, the- one of my favorite like, single lines in the whole thing is Lem, in court, saying, ‘point one, you think you’re ghosts now.’ [Austin, Ali, and Jack laugh]
Keith: Oh yeah, that was great.
Austin: It was brutal. Just- just dead on the floor. [Nick and Ali laugh] 
Jack: Oh yeah. I- I like that one. That core thing was- Okay. so-
Austin: Uh hm.
Jack: Austin, I've got a bone to pick with you here. 
Austin: Sure.
Jack:  Which is that in the span of like, three episodes-
Austin:  Uh huh. 
Jack: -you had me write poetry on air-
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: -and then you know, make a serviceable legal defense. [laughs]
Austin: And you did both wonderfully, Jack. 
Keith: To be fair, I only had to do the second one, but I didn't even have any things to prepare with. [Austin laughs] 
Jack: But you were working for your friend! You- [laughs] 
Ali: You were also working for your friend, wait. 
Keith: My friend just murdered the friend that I- that I liked more.
Jack: No, I was working against you. I was trying to convict you. Like, I was trying to find like, fun legal loophole game. Which I might add led to me getting sentenced toof like, life in Nacre as a- as a on-retainer  librarian.
Keith: Eh, you’re out. You’re fine. [Austin laughs]
Ali: God. 
Jack: God. Lem is bat- Len is ‘holiday gone wrong.’ 
Austin: Yeah.
Jack: Through and through. [Ali and Nick laugh]
Ali: Yeah, I um- I didn't answer before when it was like, ‘what are people doing after the Sun’s Day festival’, and I still keep going back to the idea that like, Hella feels really, really bad for almost leaving Lem in Nacre.
Austin: Yeah. [Jack laughs] It was real close. 
Ali: Cause they were- We- we went to the palace. 
Austin: Yep. 
Ali: We sure did. Um, aww. Lem is such a precious soul.
Austin: That’s true. 
Ali: I love that. [laughs]
Jack: The thing that kind of hurt, I think- that didn't hurt me, Jack de Quidt- it hurt me, Jack de Quidt as Lem hearing things that Lem would never hear, was how quick you and Fero were, almost without believing it yourselves, going like, ‘Oh, Lem will love it here. [Austin and Ali laugh] Like, loves to be- love- loves to be in Nacre. Sure, yeah. He loves to be in Nacre.’ And then just going to go, which was you know... yeah.
Austin: Yeah, it was rough.
Jack: I don't hold grudges. 
Austin: So, what are some other- other people's high points? 
Keith: I just want to say real quick. Matt Mitchel says, ‘I saw Keith in real life, and he was a little more Fero-sized than I would have suspected.’ I'm five ten. I don’t know what you’re talkin’ about. [Ali and Austin laugh] Five ten is not that short.
Austin: Other high points? 
Ali: The dandelion moment.
Art: Learning Keith’s height. [Austin and Ali laugh]
Austin: What's the- wait, what’s the dandelion moment?
Ali: When the final spell that-
Dre: Uklan. Uklan pattern magic,
Ali: -Uklan does. Yeah, Uklan does. 
Austin: There's a dandelion involved in that?
Ali: Yeah, he throws it in the air, and then-
Dre: He throws the dandelion.
Austin:  I don't-
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: I vaguely remember this. I know I ran that game. 
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: I know these are the- I know you're telling me words that I said to describe a thing, but I was probably in a fugue state. [Jack laughs]
Dre: Here’s the thing you should know about that fight-
Ali: [laughs] All- all of the moments.
Dre: -when we first- we first got in that room, the thought crossed my mind that maybe that big mirror that Uklan’s in front of is like, what's stopping him from actually helping. And it crossed my mind that I should shoot that mirror- 
Austin: [exhales] Ohhh.
Dre: -and like, break it. 
Austin: That would be a whole- I don't- We would have-
Dre: If I'd done that, things would have gone real bad. 
Austin: Yeah, I mean, no. We would have had to run a different- we would have had to have run another session of me trying to figure out how to sneak you all back to Velas somehow. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: Y’all were real far away. 
Ali: Well, Sunder could have just made like, a bubble.
Austin: Uh, no. Cause it was a weird different situation. That situation-
Ali: Yeah.
Austin:  -maybe isn't as clear as I thought it was, in terms of where they were. They were not- 
Art: I mean we were all the way down, right?
Austin: Yeah.
Art: We were in-
Austin: They were not in a different dimension in that-
Art: We were in the City of First Light. 
Austin:  They were in the City of First Light. Like, for realsies. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: Which is- 
Ali: Ooh- 
Austin: -in that little place. 
Ali: -my god. 
Austin: Yeah, real far. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Ali: Oh boy. 
Austin: So- so yeah. 
Ali: It’s funny cause I remember-
Art: Although we could have gotten the moment that I... 
Ali: Hm?
Austin: Art?
Art: Oh, we could have gotten the moment I've always wanted is that- is Hadrian going to the volcano.
Austin: Right that- hmm, that has to be... That can't be yet, right? Like- like, as students of- of narratives, Art, you and I must know that that has to come after a lot more trauma, right?
Art: Yeah, that’s- that’s not-
Austin: It can’t be season one ending stuff. 
Art: Right, but if we were stuck there... 
Austin: Right.
Art: He's gonna go. 
Austin: Yes. Yes. 
Art: But people are getting the fall out of that thing. Yeah, I thought that was more obvious. 
Austin: Which- what's that? 
Art: It’s that Samot is still alive. That's huge.
Austin: Yes. Yeah.
Art: Yeah. Samot is still alive, and it's terrifying.
Austin: Yep. Jim Anson says, ‘Ali mentioned Austin sent y'all playlists to get into character. Do we get to see one of those?’ 
Ali: I'm pulling up the link-
Austin: Yeah, just link it. Just link them.
Ali:  - of them right now. I’m just gonna link them in the… 
Dre: Yeah, Spotify list. 
Austin: Your Spotify lists.
Dre: Not only is Samot alive, but maybe has mind control over Fantasmo? 
Austin: Oh man, that moment is great. That was one of my- my favorite moments of like- of like, ‘Ooo, a player said an interesting thing, and I'm just gonna just see if I can like, twist it a little bit because like, how do you cast mind-control on a god? And the answer is like, I really like the answer of like-
Nick: Yeah. [Ali and Nick laugh]
Austin: -it works both ways. I'm really excited-
Nick: Right. 
Austin: That's the thing that I'm actually excited about is how that- how that comes into the foreground in the next season. 
Nick: Yeah, me too. And like, how does that change Fantasmo? Because now, he has- not only does he have someone who genuinely counts on him-
Austin: Uh hm. 
Nick: -but he has memories of being-
Austin: Right. 
Nick: -a confidant-
Austin: Yes. 
Nick: -for this very powerful person. 
Austin: Yes. Yep.  
Nick: Like what- [laughs] 
Austin: Yep, absolutely. There was a question- 
Jack: Oh, I guess-
Austin: Go ahead, Jack. 
Jack: Oh, I was just gonna say really briefly about Uklan working magic. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: Austin and I had several-
Austin: Oh yeah.
Jack: -really torturous conversations, at least on my part, about what the hell active pattern magic looked like. And every time we talked Austin would ask questions, and I just sort of tried to say interesting things and fall flat every single time. [Austin laughs] Which you can see in the difference- and I mean I guess I still had a lot of time to think about it before Uklan eventually turned up, but you can see that in that Lem uses pattern magic to make a rock appear in front of somebody, and literally the first thing Uklan does is light a fire with a combination of twigs and a bit of his belt. 
Austin: Right. The big difference-
Jack: So, it was really- it was like, a really nice surprise for me.
Austin: So, there are- there are two things that I think I want to say about that. Which is one, Uklan and Sunder were both there obviously for- for Fantasmo to bounce off of, right? 
Jack: Mm.
Austin: Because- because of Fantasmo’s kind of beef with the Archives and his history with Sunder. But they were also there to make it interesting for Jack and for players who are really inter- or sorry listeners who are really interested in the archivists that were afraid that they wouldn't get that stuff on that side of the game. And it's the same thing with why I included like the Disciples of Fantasmo in the Nacre side game.
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: Like I wanted to make sure there were bits of each campaign in the other, not only because like, you know, for dramatic irony, but also just like, interest. So, that's one thing. 
Nick: Hm. 
Austin: The second thing is I figured out pattern magic. I may have told Jack this story, but I- I don't know that I told other people this. I figured out what pattern magic looked like when I was home for Christmas, and I was making myself coffee and I put in- I put in some cream, and I put in some sugar.And when I put in the sugar, the coffee cup just exploded. 
Jack: Oh, you didn't tell me this. This is new to me.
Austin:  Okay. Okay, that happened. And I was like, ‘whaaa- that's not like- What happened?’ And there wasn't- Nothing. Like there wasn't- it just- Sometimes things work weird. Sometimes the exact right amount of sugar in coffee that's exactly this hot in a cup that's made exactly of this, produced this effect that's entirely unpredictable unless you're like- because there’s just too many variables. 
Keith Wait, are you saying the cup shattered?
Austin: Yes. 
Keith: That's very weird.
Austin: It was super weird. And then I poured another cup, and it was fine. Like it wasn't- it was totally okay. It was just like-
Jack: And this was when Austin discovered he was magic. [Ali laughs]
Austin: Right, that's when I discovered that I was doing- But what that reminded me of at the time was like, ‘oh, this is- this thing that Jack and I have talked about that sometimes people in the world of Hieron just do pattern magic by mistake. And sometimes it's little things like, their coffee cup explodes. And sometimes it's big things like, their city explodes.’ [Jack laughs] Because like, sometimes just things arrange themselves in that way that- that- the whole world is contingent on this magic shit, and- and it could just be arranged in a weird way sometimes. Things can just be- you know the- the Jenga tower can just come undone because- because the wind blows the right way. 
Jack: Mm. 
Nick:  Mm. 
Austin: And- and realizing that's what the effect kind of looks like made me realize the sort of stuff that Uklan Tel had to do. Which is all about little bits of stuff moving in very specific ways, you know?
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: Also yeah, real talk.
Jack: Was him-
Austin: In chat, Dre is saying thank you to silverskinned for the amazing fanart, and yes, it’s amazing.
Jack: Yeah, it's brilliant. 
Ali: Yep. 
Dre: It’s good. 
Nick: Yeah. 
Austin: Uh, what were you gonna say, Jack? 
Jack: Oh, I was just gonna say like, now you know that the dandelion was the thing you made up, there's a moment where Uklan Tel is sitting by the um- at the camp, and he's just pulling flowers and grass up from around his feet while he's listening to them talking-.
Austin: Uh hm. 
[1:00:00]
Jack: -was that deliberate foreshadowing for the ending or…?
Austin: No, but it was- I guess it was me still thinking about what Uklan Tel does. Which is lots of... he said- he fiddles with things. You know what I mean? Like he's kind of just like, ‘I need to like- I'm messing with stuff. I think- Though, wait.’
Jack: And then a weird thing happens. 
Austin: Though wait. Cause I did have that escape plan in motion. I did know that that was the escape. I did understand at that point that that's how they were gonna get back out through the blizzard if they didn't- if they needed a quick escape route. If they didn't have the supplies to get back out was that I could always have Uklan Tel just like, do his pattern magic stuff. So maybe I was already- and I did set him up as like, having been doing a big spell even back then. Like I did- I did have him doing some things to prepare. That might have literally just been me thinking, ‘oh yeah, dandelions look good for this twice.’ But without actually making that connective tissue myself. Someone in the chat, I think Kenton Clay says, ‘I imagine Samot looks like Dio from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure.’ Um, that's close. It's actually really close. 
Keith: Does seem likeseems Ronnie James Dio. 
Austin: [laughs] Right. Yeah, he actually looks like Ronnie Dio- James Dio.
Keith: Good.
Ali: Isn’t he uh, Legends of Galactic- something character.
Austin: He is. He’s- he’s Reinhard from- from Legend of Galactic. Legend of Galactic Heroes. Which is an anime that is very, very great. 
Art: Oh, I always thought Samot looked like the boy squid amiibo. 
Austin: Yeah, that’s him. [Jack and Ali laugh] Yep. [Nick laughs]
Dre: You’re a God. You’re a kid. You’re a squid. [Austin laughs] 
Austin: Aw, I want to play- I want to play that game so bad. 
Ali: Aw, what a precious god boy. Look at him. 
Austin: Yeah, he’s kind of precious. [laughs] Yeah, that’s it. 
Nick: Oh yeah. 
Austin: It's the one Keith linked. That's it. [Dre, Ali, Nick, and Austin laugh] 
Jack: Yeah, definitely. 
Austin: So, are there other questions from the chat? That I missed? 
Ali: Uh-
Nick: Uh-
Austin: I was tryin’ to keep up. 
Ali: There were...
Nick: I had some-
Austin: Sure.
Nick: -collected, too. 
Austin: Sure.
Nick: Oh, you go, too, Ali. Do you have any?
Ali: I had a- like, a thing up, but then it closed it, so- but you saved it on the thing.
Jack: Oh no. 
Nick: Ok. [Dre laughs] Um, [thinking noises] ber-ber-ber, let's see- [Austin laughs] Rhetorical Acrobat asked, ‘did you all have a general idea or direction you wanted to take your character in for- the from the set out? Or was the direction you took them entirely improvised based on circumstances?’ 
Austin: That's for you all to answer, so-
Nick: Yeah.
Art: I mean, I think if anyone doesn’t say improvise, they're a liar, right? [Nick laughs]
Dre: Yeah.
Ali: Yeah. 
Nick: Yeah, I mean obviously like, the- the whole... the way Dungeon World works, and you know, the whole style of the thing means that a lot of our characters ended up being improvised. If any- no one else has something, I- I've got something for this. 
Ali: I-
Nick: I swear I didn't pick it for that reason. 
Ali: Um, yeah I don't know. I think with Hella I was always... and I've spoken to Austin about this a lot, but I was always trying to do like, the most interesting thing with her instead of the thing like, that I wanted to do. 
Austin: That you as the- as like, the player felt safest doing, in other words?
Ali: Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think I kind of like- [laughs] I um... I don’t know. There was specifically with our finale I um- I should’ve like- I could have kept her with like, the- the link to Calhoun, and that would have been really fun. And I wanted to keep doing that, but I think her being with the queen is so much more interesting. Um, and then also just like, having to kill him and then like, not lying to distrap- uh, ta-show...Oh my god, I can't pronounce anything… [Austin laughs] at all. Uh, when that was like, an option on the table that I definitely could have done, but didn't? Um-
Austin: Right. 
Ali: And then like, specifically just her as a character like, because I've played like- like really nice characters or like, really mean like bounty hunters or whatever, but like, never in a way that I've tried to play Hella. 
Austin: Uh hm.
Ali: And if we're gonna, in season two of Friends at the Table, I can say that what I have next is definitely gonna be my most self- selfish character.
Austin: [laughs] We excited. [Dre laughs] Uh, Nick, you said you had a thing?
Art: It was Hella’s altruism that I thought was her most- [Austin, Ali, and Art laugh]
Austin: Defining trait. It’s true. 
Art: Yeah. 
Ali: No, no, no. I mean- 
Austin: What here is altruistic? 
Ali: -selfish as in like, what like, bullshit I want to do. 
Austin: Right. You selfish, as a player, not selfish as a character.
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Yeah. Hella’s super selfish. Wait, what? [laughs]
Art: Yeah.
Nick: Oh, uh- Civil Twilight had a good follow-up to that question to which, I think, Ali covered a little bit, but ‘has your conception of your character changed radically over the first season?’ 
Keith: Um-
Austin: Keith? 
Nick: Go ahead. 
Keith: I think that uh, there's the- there's a- there's a moment… if you get- Do you guys remember? You guys all remember when Hadrian murdered that skeleton for no reason? 
Jack: Uh, yes.
Austin: Yeah. 
Nick: Oh yeah.
Art: But uh, Hadrian killed that monster that was bothering us? Yeah. I remember that.
Ali: In- in defense of his pals? And cause he was on a divine mission?
Nick: Like a bunch of people have been asking about that skeleton. [Ali laughs]
Austin: Skele- That skeleton…
Keith: Well-
Austin: Yeah, wow. 
Keith: -the- the deci-
Nick: I thought it was clear though. He was the caretaker. 
Austin: Yeah.
Keith: Right.
Nick: Right? 
Austin: Yeah.
Nick: Yeah. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: He was also a dwarf. He was the only dwarf we've had in this game so far. 
Jack: Yeah, and Hadrian murdered him. 
Keith: Yeah.
Nick: Oh, was he?
Ali: Yeah.
Art: He was a skeleton monster, dwarf caretaker? Yeah.
Austin: Also, his wife- 
Art: Good work there, Hadrian.
Austin: Everyone just like, missed that his wife was on the roof of the tower. Keith went up there to talk to those birds, and his wife was up there. 
Ali: Whaaat?  
Austin: That- that happened. If you go back and listen to like, listen for that-
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: It’s just that- boy, was he has a sad situation. It was sad. 
Jack: Wait, is his wife dead? Austin: Oh yeah. 
Keith: Oh, that’s who that body was? 
Austin: Yeah, dog. 
Dre: Yeah, she was getting eaten by the birds.
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Oh.
Jack: Oh man. 
Nick: Ugh.
Austin: It was sad. 
Keith: That’s very sad. 
Jack: And so, she was a really- He was a painter, right? 
Austin: He was a painter. 
Ali:  And she was like, a bad painter and that was like, that one painting that was in- [Dre laughs] Ahh. 
Austin: She was like, an amateur painter. He was like, a pro. 
Ali: I know. 
Austin: They were- but they were in love. 
Ali: I know. 
Austin: They were very nice. 
Ali: And she stayed with him.
Jack: And he spent all his efforts painting her when he should have been painting like- like the thing he would have to paint, right?
Ali: Yeah, the-
Austin: Yeah, which was like, the tower. He was supposed to like, be doing touch-ups, you know? 
Keith: Uh, and so- so when- when Hadrian went to confront this skeleton, and demolished the skeleton in less than one hit, Fero’s- Fero’s choice there was to like, back Hadrian up. And I think that that was the decision that like, I don't think I would have made in any other decide- I don't know why I made the decision to be like, ‘oh, I guess since this is what we're doing…’ Uh, so I guess the- the biggest way that my character changed was from that first session forward, I think that- that Fero kind of was more interested in- in like… uh, bullsh- I guess bullshit heroics. [Austin and Jack laugh] 
Austin: Yes. 
Keith: Cause I didn't- I didn’t want to be caught in a situation,and- and then it ended up- it ended up happening a second time in the very final episode, but I basically- I was like, I don't want to do any backing up of the people that I'm with, if I'm not all for what's going on. 
Austin: Right. 
Keith: And then- and then ended up making the same mistake in the finale when we killed the Queen, but…
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: That's- that's the- that's the big shift for Fero was that immediately I was like, ‘well, that's not what I want to do anymore.’ 
Austin: I like-
Nick: Bullshit Heroics: The Fero Feritas story. [Ali and Jack laugh]
Austin: Fero definitely becomes a- like, for the majority of the middle of that campaign and for the holiday season- er holiday special, Fero’s whole bit is like, ‘No. No. No! Like, no! Let’s not do this. This is ridiculous. Why would we ever do this?’ [Ali and Nick laughs]
Keith: Yeah, which is- which I think in a lot of- in a lot of circumstances is kind of boring. Just having a like, ‘I'm the hero guy,’ but when everyone else is not doing that, it- I think it's like, when the one person that wants to be the hero is really just the one person, I think it makes it a little more interesting. 
Nick: Yeah, and I thought it fit really well because I mean Fero is like, everyone's a little buddy, you know? And-
Keith: Not anymore. 
Nick: He's doing it- Well, [laughs] 
Keith: Starting right now. 
Nick: Like one, he was- [Dre and Jack laugh] He was doing it- he was doing it cause he cared.
Keith: Right. 
Nick: Like he wasn't just like- it wasn't Fantasmo- if Fantasmo was saying that stuff. it would have- he would have been trying to protect his own skin. But Fero, you know. But also it just- it- you know, it makes sense that this little Hobbit shape-shifting animal dude who's already very low to the ground is very grounded. [Nick and Art laugh] 
Jack: Well, but at the same time, Fero is capable of just- just like, essentially smashing through narrative windows thinking like, ‘Okay, I’m Fero now!’ 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Nick: Yeah. That’s true.
Jack: Like in the tower where he just breaks into Lem in the tower after- while Lem is studying for the case. And I- I love that a great deal, especially because- [laughs] because my reaction there was twofold. It was Lem’s reaction of shock, and by that point, I already knew that I was gonna have to do some like, weird lateral thinking-
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: -and as a player, I genuinely worried that- that Keith had screwed that up. But it was funny and interesting, so I didn't like mind. [Nick laughs] But my-
Keith: Lem is a little bit Jack Burton.
Austin: Mm. 
Jack: Well, so here’s- Like, I kinda want to talk about this actually in that like, this is the first- Well, I don't know. Austin and I have- have designed tabletop games together before, but this is the first sort of big tabletop game I've played, and I think a lot of- a lot of my reliance on a character that I felt very comfortable with comes through as a result of that. Like you know, if you've followed me on Twitter, there is definitely a large Venn diagram overlap between things Lem likes and things I like. And in our next thing that we're doing, that is something that I'm pushing hard away from. But something that interested me a lot and especially in terms of character change was that I grew to like Lem less. 
Austin: Yeah, uh hm. 
Jack: I didn't grow to like, that playing him less at all. In fact, I loved playing him throughout, and I'm really excited to play him again in the future. But as a character, I grew to like him less.
Austin: As-
Jack: He became more selfish-
Austin: Yes. 
Jack: -and more naive. Or if not naive, he was willfully blind to a bunch of stuff. 
Austin: Yeah I think - I think- 
Jack: And the game-
Austin: [interjecting] One of my favorite things with that was that for a lot of time, it was easy to see Lem as the- it was easy to take the kind of like, liberal progressive… and I say this- I’m far to the left, but like, the sort of like-
Jack: Yeah.
Austin: -American liberalism of- of, ‘oh, he's supposed to go around the world and look at all the cool stuff. Like he's just-’
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: ‘He's an explorer of the world,’ you know? Like ‘he's a- he's a good guy who likes to go backpacking in- in India and look at all the cool statues.’ 
Jack: Yeah, exactly. 
Austin: And then like- and then by the end of the game it's, [tone change; less enthusiastic] ‘oh, he's a cool guy who likes to go to India and look at all the statues. [Ali laughs] That’s the sort of guy he is.’ 
Jack: And the game got so much more interesting to me when I started making decisions with that almost.
Au Uh hm. 
Jack: When I started realizing that this was somebody who was going to make outright mistakes.
Austin: Yes. 
Jack: And as a player, I could choose to make those mistakes.
Austin: Right, right. Definitely. And yeah, for me that was another thing, I think, that- that- No one has asked a question about this directly, but one of the things that, as a GM, I was really upfront with right away was that like, with- with some exceptions, but- but pretty much everything that was interesting was shared at the table. There were no real pull asides. There were no quiet like, side- side bars between me and a single player, for the most part. And there was lots of- and we kind of had to face this dead-on with the holiday special, there was lots of like, ‘oh, we know what the outcome of this is going to be.’ And we can still make this interesting. In fact, we can make it more interesting because we know what the outcome is going to be. 
Nick: Right. 
Austin: Because we understand what the- the consequences of this are going to be, we can now play into that to produce some dramatic irony, you know? 
Jack: Definitely. Also like, that thing of like, what happens after High Sunday, I think Lem is gonna turn himself in. He made a promise to Morbash. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: I can see him doing that, I think 
Austin: Yeah, I need to- I really want to listen to the final few episodes of both sides of the- of the campaign, and then listen- do a new listen through the holiday special.
Jack: Oh, me too. 
Austin: Because I'm really curious to see how that all sounds in that order versus the order we recorded it in.
Jack: Yeah.
Nick: Uh hm. 
Austin: Very curious. Let's do a couple more questions. I'm getting exhausted. I've been- I worked all day and wrote a big thing, so... but let’s do a couple more questions. 
Keith: Oh, also for people that are still around, there's a thing at the end that we're gonna do.
Austin: Yes. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Nick: Can I- Wait, sorry. 
Ali: Um-
Jack: It’s the entire season two, live. 
Keith: [laughs] At once. In one take. [Nick laughs] 
Austin: What do you do?
Nick: Oh god. [Dre laughs] Can I- can I be a little selfish and answer that question-
Austin: Yeah. 
Nick: -also for Fantasmo? I absolutely had a fairly concrete idea for Fantasmo upfront.
Austin: Uh hm. 
Nick: And that was- I'm gonna get a little- uh, maybe a little personal and- and pretentious here, so I apologize, but Fantasmo- I made Fantasmo as the character that as- as the man that I am genuinely afraid of becoming. 
Austin: Right. 
Nick: Like me, Nick. Nick Scratch. Like, I- And- and someone that I could have absolutely been on the path to. And I wanted to- I wanted to analyze that other me- 
Austin: Yeah. 
Nick: -that other almost could have been me through- through role-playing and stuff, but also kind of like, make fun of myself. [laughs]
Austin: Right. 
Nick: In a way.
Austin: That comes through. That comes through.
[1:15:00]
Nick: And I... I think the direction that it- that he's gone, so far is- Like, I absolutely have an arc in mind for him that I hope that I can get, but you know, whatever, I'm not super married to it. But... I uh- I really hope that I can- I also just want to make it super clear that I am not Fantasmo, at all. Like I-
Austin: No, I don’t think that that- I think no one has that in their mind. That’s not something you need to waste time like… worrying about.
Nick: Sometimes- sometimes I genuinely felt really bad putting the other people through the shit that Fantasmo put them through. 
Austin: Sure. Yes.
Ali: Yeah, that’s a feeling you can have as a player, for sure. 
Austin: Yeah, I think- I think both Hella and Fantasmo did that to- and- and probably Hadrian, too, in the holiday special. But yeah, I don’t know. I think- I think as long as you focus on making- making the ways that you kind of frustrate the other characters the focus-
Nick: Uh hm. 
Austin: -and not like, ‘how can I frustrate the other players?’ that still ends up being a very productive sort of moment. Do you know what I mean? Like the- 
Nick: Yeah.
Austin: There are lots of frustrating characters in fiction. The best of them are really interesting because they're frustrating. So-
Jack: Yeah. 
Nick: Okay. Sorry.
Austin: Other questions? 
Nick: I- I had to get that off my chest. 
Austin: No, yeah.
Ali: Deepflawed asked a question about the Nacre curse-
Austin: Oh yeah.
Ali: -which is ‘was the curse in Nacre intended to be just that it spreads when you leave it or is immortality there entirely? Because I thought it was the former, but the way at the end, it seemed it was the latter, and I wasn't sure if that was the case or just what…’
Austin: The…
Ali: ‘-uh, the- the players- what the characters thought.’
Austin: Here's the way Nacre works. If you've spent a day in Nacre- if you spend a few- if you’re there overnight, anywhere you go after that and spend a day is also part of Nacre. Also has the curse of- of immortality. So consider that going forward, for instance. [Jack laughs]
Ali: Mm. 
Dre: But Austin, isn’t the line broken? 
Austin: No, it turns out. It turns out nah. [Ali and Dre laugh] 
Ali: No, it definitely is. 
Jack: It never was. 
Ali: Hella saved the day. 
Austin: It definitely could be. But Hella’s still walkin’ around, so that’s weird. 
Ali: Hella saved the day. No. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Keith: Austin, I need you to- [inaudible]
Ali: She saved Ordenna.
Austin: Uh hm.
Keith: One of us is gonna have to figure out if we're ghosts or not. 
Austin:  I- Yeah, I don't know. Good question. 
Keith: And I don't know. Ghost bird sounds pretty cool. [Austin and Nick laugh]
Ali: I want so much of this-
Nick: Or-
Ali: -Hella not to just end with her killing herself cause she realizes... 
Austin: Yeah, it needs to not. 
Ali: Because when she dies again and wakes up as a zombie, she's just gonna be like, ‘Hadrian, please snap my neck. Thank you.
Austin: Let’s not steal from the season finale of season two, please. [Ali, Nick, and Keith laugh] 
Ali: Mm. 
Austin: Other questions? It sounds like, we're just about- Let’s wait for the chat to catch up, and then we’ll take one or two more questions. 
Nick: Keith, what if you turn into a dog when you were a ghost?
Keith: Well, I was sup- I was going to have- I had planned-
Austin: I got it- I got it, Nick. [Nick laughs]
Keith: Huh? 
Austin: Don't worry about it.
Keith: Oh.
Nick: Sorry. [Dre laughs]
Austin: Ghost dog. He’d be a ghost dog. [pause]
Art: Way of the samurai? 
Austin: There it is. 
Keith: [whispering] Team ghost dog. 
Austin: You should. It’s good. There's a good- there’s a good- good relationships in it. 
Ali: Yea- [exhales]
Austin: Uh-huh? What's up? 
Ali: I feel like- Oh…[winds down and laughs] So like, how’s Velas doing? [Nick and Ali laugh]
Austin: Good question. Bad, I think. I think rough. I think it's rough in Velas right now. It's very... I don't know. We'll find out, right? 
Keith: They got their whole holiday ruined. 
Austin: Yeah, it was bad. 
Ali: Yeah, that’s such-
Austin: And then like- 
Ali: -such a bummer. 
Austin: The- one of the major sources of like, kind of cultural powered died, so…
Dre: Got shot with a laser gun.
Austin: The laser gun. 
Nick: Oh, here's a good question from Blazing Raven that I had saved here. Uh, this is a question for Keith and Jack, ‘if the shit that happened to the city didn't happen, would Lem have stayed, and would Fero have stayed with him?
Austin: Ooo, that's a good question.
Keith: I don't think Fero would have stayed. I don't- I don't think Fero likes Nacre at all. [light laugh] 
Jack: As loathed as I am to admit it, I think Lem probably would have stayed. I think Lem knows that his number is probably up in the Archives, and there's definitely something nice to him about being offered that job. I mean that job offer gets very different when they say you have to stay here forever. [Ali laughs]
Austin: Right. Right. 
Jack: And you have to like, leave this doomed town with us. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: But he got on well with that dude who gave him a big box of poetry that he lost in the end, right?
[crosstalking]
Austin: Yeah, he lost the poetry box.
Jack: Didn’t he lose his poetry thing? Yeah. 
Ali: Does-
Nick: Oh.
Austin: Uh hm?
Jack: Hm?
Nick: Was- Is that- That was a box of poetry that he gave him?
Austin: There were- So, there were two boxes, I think?
Nick: Okay. 
Austin: He ended up giving you also a box to give to Gregalos. 
Dre: Mm.
Jack: Ah, yes. 
Austin: Which you gave to Gregalos.
Nick: Oh, that's who- Ok. 
Austin: And that’s the box that Gregalos had in his room when he was killed. 
Nick: Ohhhhh.
Austin: Yeah. 
Nick: Alright. 
Austin: Yes.
Jack: Um, Jim Anson asks, ‘how much of the settings/description stuff is improv, and how much is written out/planned ahead of time?’
Austin: Yes. 
Jack: ‘Like, the narration feels very specific sometimes. Is any of that written out in advance?’
Austin: Some of it is, but- but- So, there's kind of like three modes, right? Like there- is there is, ‘ok, here's a big bit that I've written out that is like- this is- just needs to be a big specific thing. I want to paint a picture of this one space. Or like, of this one person or something,’ right? I'm looking through my thirty pages of- of Nacre notes now. 
Ali: [laughs] Oh.
Austin: But there's also just like- So like, for instance... Like, I have the description of Ventaro Doce, the advisor and librarian. That I have written out, right? Or like, the names of all of the titles of Triste- of Adelaide and Calhoun. But I also just have like, lists of things. Like alabaster, ivory, marble, pearl. White, gold, red. Everything has delicate inlays. Masked courtesans. Wide staircases, right? Like, I just have things like that in that way here. I think there's a better list somewhere . Oh yeah. Like, bespoke, squared off tower. Dozens of ships docked. The Kingdom Come in its Bay. Like that's- 
Jack: Right. 
Austin: Like okay, I'll hit that- I'll hit that. And I'll expand on that with improv to give it a little bit more flavor. But that's about… That tends to be the majority of how I bring color to a place. I do the same thing with Auniq. I did the same thing with some of the sections of the fallen tower. Some of those had longer write-ups, too. But lots of them were just those sorts of like, impressions that then I built on to give it a little bit more of a- of a big picture thing, you know? Let's do one more, I think.
Nick: Speaking of like, written- the more written things. 
Austin: Yeah.
Nick: I just want to say every single character name is fantastic. 
Austin: I appreciate that. I also have to give some credit to Jack for especially the holiday episodes because he came up with a large number of the holiday characters. 
Nick: Oh right. Sure
Austin: I mean not- but the names. I went to Jack and was like, ‘Listen. I need thirty-five names immediately.’ [Jack and Nick laugh] And he was like, ‘uhh, I’ll give you these.’ And then I tinkered with them a little bit, but like, mostly it's the same. And that was really good. What else? There was something else I wanted to mention. 
Nick: But yeah, like, especially when there's pairs of characters. Like, the names-
Austin: Yeah. 
Nick: -just like, make me want to write like, whole books of their adventures. 
Austin: Yeah, like- Yeah. 
Nick: You know, Solomon and Lake. Like-
Austin: Right, Uklan Tel and Sunder. 
Nick: Jesus, yes. 
Austin: Yeah, no. I- 
Nick: Yep. 
Austin: The paired characters for me is like, one of my favorite bits about this game. Again there are lots of those pairspair. There really are. And they're all really great. There's also... I do want- I do want to say, and I will like, pat myself on the back this one time, is at the end of the first-
Jack: Ohhh.
Austin: -full session of the holiday special-
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: -where we were wrapping up, and I do a little monologue about the snow hitting in the middle of the- the heat?
Nick: Oh yeah. 
Austin: That was completely extemporaneous. That had no- nothing had written down other than like-
Jack: Oh, wow. 
Austin: -’It snowed- question mark?’ [Austin and Ali laugh] 
Nick: Right. 
Austin: And then it was just like, a moment of like- That was one of those moments of we're all exhausted- I'm so tired, but I've broken through my- my sleepiness to like- [Jack laughs]
Nick: Sure. 
Austin: -being able to be evocative. Sorry, there's something loud outside my window. Yeah, to be able to be evocative again, and that was like- that turned out really well. I'm really happy with that one. That was- that was really good. 
Jack: And  I think there's a- there's a moment in some of the stuff we've recorded for what's coming next, where you do a big pre-written speech. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: I'm thinking about the last recording. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Jack: And it's super feels like, you've taken on board everything that you worked on in the first season, and like, that stuff feels amazing now in the same way.
Austin: I think so. I hope. I hope so. We'll see. We’ll see how it all turns out. 
Jack: Uh hm.
Austin: Um, speaking of, I think we should- we should get there unless there’s one- one more question. I don't think so. I think this is-
Art: There's a few- there’s some- there’s some plot nit-picking in the chat. 
Austin: Oh, okay. Well... [Ali laughs] Like, ok. Like what? [Austin and Jack laugh]
Art: Uh, if- if they carried the curse back to Velas-
Austin: Uh huh. 
Art: -how did the people in the holiday special die?
Austin: Yep. People don't- it doesn't- Towns aren't like, magic in the sense that like, ‘oh, I'm in the town. Now the whole town has this curse on it.’ Towns are physical spaces. So it- they literally carry it to the physical spaces that they spend time in. Whereas like- like I don't think that anyone from- from uh… from the boat party hung out and that in- that temple all night, right? 
Art: Sure. 
Austin: Whereas I bet you it might be in the Ordenna- the Ordennan embassy. I bet you it might be with the... you know, wherever- wherever Lem and Fero stayed overnight. 
Jack: Oh, no. Morbash.  
Austin: Right, right. So, those things are a lot more... That's- that's the thing, right? The whole city doesn't magically get it all at once. Adam Ody says, ‘Austin, I can't believe how- how cohes- how cohesive it all felt.’ Me either! Because like- [Ali and Dre laugh] it was put together with duct tape and glue. Uh, so you know. So.
Nick: Would have never guessed.
Austin: Yes. 
Nick: Honestly.
Austin: Yeah, I- you know. Alright.
Nick: No, I mean that it was put together with duct tape and glue.
Austin: [laughs lightly] No, no. I understand. I do. 
Nick: Okay 
Austin: I appreciate it. Alright. Let's- let's- let's fade out here, but I need everyone- I can't play it for everybody... um, because I don't have audio sharing hooked up right now because my computer's been really bad. 
Nick: Hm. 
Austin: So, Keith, can you link… the Google drive in-
Keith: I can. I can link it. Yeah. 
Austin: And then everyone else- don’t start listening to it yet, but load it up and then we'll all hit play at the same time. 
Jack: Or just switch over to the stream, I guess.
Austin: No, because then there’ll be a delay, right? Or I guess you can. 
Jack: Oh right. 
Austin: I just want to hear your reactions live.
Keith: It’s still- it's still like, ten or fifteen seconds of a delay. 
Austin: Yeah 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: So let's just-
Keith: So, theres’s-
Austin: Let me know when everyone is ready to hit play, and I will count us in. 
Art: I’m ready to hit play. 
Austin: Uh. 
Nick: Ok.
Jack: Uh, let me find it. 
Nick: Ready.
Jack: I'm just getting it. Nope. Um… 
Keith: Ready
Ali:  I'm ready. 
Jack: Wait. 
Austin: Still waitin’ on Art and Dre?
Art: Yeah, I'm ready.
Dre: Nah, I'm good. 
Austin: Alright, so we're ready. We're all ready? 
Jack: Ok, ready.
Art: I think we’re waiting on Jack.
Austin: Uh hm, alright. No, I think we're all ready. So, when I say ‘play-’
Jack: I’m ready. 
Austin: - we're gonna hit play. It's gonna be... I'm gonna- I'm gonna count down, and then I'm going to say the word. [Ali laughs] And then you're goin- hmm… This is-
Keith: Ok.
Austin:  Ok Three, two-
Keith: It’s good.
Austin: Hmmm. What, Keith? [Ali laughs] 
Nick: Was that it?
Keith: I was just gonna say-
Austin: That was not it. 
Keith: -go on ‘go.’ That’s what-
Austin: Right.  Yes.
Keith: Right.
Austin: Three, two, one, go.
[Jack de Quidt’s “The Long Way Around” begins playing]
[unknown voice] T-minus ten, nine, eight, seven. And we have main engine start. Five, four, three, two, one, zero. And lift off. 
[another voice] Lift off of Mission 41D. The first flight of the Orbiter Discovery. And the shuttle has cleared the tower. [piano begins] 
Austin: Who is really pulling the strings behind the scenes? 
Art: The network is always talking about everything that just happened. 
Austin: This is a world of subterfuge, politics and espionage. [pause] Trading harm back and forth is kind of the engine that drives this whole game. 
[Neil Armstrong] Here, men from the planet Earth, first set foot upon the Moon. 
Austin: The sky was scarred at the climax of the Golden War. 
[Neil Armstrong] We came in peace for all mankind. 
Austin: If someone does something like that again, it’s going to be so, so much more devastating. [pause] We could have built them to lookthem look like anything, but we made them look like us. [dawn chorus starts] A perfect planet now cautiously inhabited by a small group. It taunts those left behind on Counterweight. Its green continents. Its unfrozen seas. It is so far away, but there it is. Every night. So, so close. 
[Jack de Quidt’s “The Long Way Around” finishes]
Austin: So, that's a preview of our next season. [Ali squeals with delight and laughs] [Jack and Dre laugh] [Jack’s clock chimes]
Art: I can't tell you how glad I am there wasn't any fish jokes in there. [Austin and Ali laugh] 
Austin: Yeah, yeah. So-
Keith: You think I’d waste time in the trailer to put fish jokes? [Jack laughs]
Austin: [laughs] You would. 
Ali: You would.
Art: Yeah, uh huh. 
Keith: I wa- Hold on. 
Austin: Oh, Keith. 
[1:30:00]
Keith: I want- I want everybody to go back and listen to every episode of Friends at the Table and see if there was a single joke in any of the episode recaps. [whispering] There wasn’t. There wasn’t one.
Ali: Yeah. Actually, Keith has said many times...
Jack: Except for that one where robot Art arrived. [Ali laughs] 
Austin: Um, ETA- VirtuaSphere says, ’any ETA?’ The… we've already recorded world building and character building... character building ep. Though both those things will go up the week after next- I think. I think we’ll- so, the plan is to release this this week. Next week we'll just release just that trailer in its finished form, whatever the fi- Like, if that- if that's final, that's final. But we’ll release that as just a single episode, and the week after that, when I'm back from E3, we’ll release the first character building episode, as a standalone. And we still have to record the actual first full game session. 
Jack: Do we want to say what the game is? People are asking what the game is.
Austin: Yeah, let’s- I do- I do want to- I'll talk a little bit about this. So, I'm running a game called-
Nick: Will, in the chat,,, Will in the chat says, ‘So, wait. Duckburg is in space?’ [Austin laughs]
Ali: Yes. 
Austin: Yes. Um, so this- this new game that I'm running is… Huh. There’s still going to be two parties, in a sense. Or two games. The first game is going to be a game of what's called Mech Noir, which is kind of an official hack of a game called Technoir, by a guy named Jeremy Keller. It is a cyberpunk meets mech game that focuses on the kind of structure of film noir storytelling. The sort of back and forth between protagonists and antagonists. And the whole thing revolves around the... around adjectives in a really interesting way that I think will be really great with the party that- that we have. The game is science fiction and cyberpunk and anime and mecha. The big influences for me are kind of- uh, it’s cou- it’s a couple things. It's obviously Blade Runner. It’s Gundam, especially 08th MS team and 0080 War in the Pocket. It's that one anime music video… uh, the Cowboy Bebop one that is- that is ‘Only in Dreams.’ The Weezer ‘Only in Dreams’ Cowboy Bebop music video. [Ali laughs] Google that if you haven't seen that because it's super that. 
Ali: You are so Austin Walker. [laughs]
Austin: I am the most Austin Walker. So, yeah. So, it is- it is going to be Art, Ali, Jack, and Keith playing Mech Noir, which is this- they're going to be in this kind of ground level mech cold war game where they are- they are set in a kind of a cold war state, a cold war planet, caught between big powers. And then there's going to be a second game, which is going to be me, Nick, and Dre where we look at what happens at the big galactic scale, the kind of space- the whole sector of space. 
We're taking these rules from a thing called Stars Without Number, which is another kind of space adventure game, but it happens to have these rules called ‘the faction turn’ which lets you play out what the different factions at the kind of galactic level are doing. And in between the Mech Noir sessions, we’ll be doing Stars Without Number of faction turns. And we're gonna mix that a little bit with kind of- the kind of freeform role-playing of a thing like Microscope so that we can say like, ‘ok, well this faction does this and this one does this.’ And then we can say, ‘Woah, woah, woah. Let's zoom in on that a little bit. Let's see what the scene in the throne room looks like when the war- when the decision to go to war is made. Let's talk about what this infiltration of this like, cyber ninja into this enemy corporation looks like.’ 
And so that will be almost like an anthology in a little way, but it will also just kind of influence and- and impact the kind of ground-level Mech Noir game. So, I'm really excited about this. It is- it is really cool. I'm really excited because our factions are great; our planets are great; our characters are fantastic. And as I just heard the music is so good. Jack, you knocked it out of the park! [Jack laughs] 
Ali: Jack~
Austin: Keith, you crushed the trailer. Thank you so much. 
Keith: No problem. 
Nick: Yeah.
Austin: I'm really excited. Also-
Art:  In season three, we're getting dubstep, right? 
Austin: Yes, season three-
Art: When we come back to Velas, we’re getting- [Jack laughs]
Austin: Yes. Yep.
Nick: You- you folks lied to me. I lost composure. [Austin laughs]
Ali: Aww.
Austin: Sorry. Sylvia in the chat says, ‘now I know why Ali was saying her character is self-indulgent. It's a goddamn Gundam game.’ Yep. Yep. 
Ali: Uh hm.
Austin: So, that's that, I think. Thank you for watching us and listening. My name is Austin Walker. You can find me @austin_walker on Twitter. TheCalcutec here on Twitch, obviously, Streamfriends on Twitch, and streamfriends.tv. You can also find the stuff I do at giantbomb.com now. That's a thing that happened. [Dre laughs] This is officially the first time that that'll go out on the podcast, I guess, huh? 
Nick, Jack, Art: [simultaneously] Yeah. 
Keith: [simultaneously] Yes. 
Ali: Yeah~
Austin: Yeah, but we-
Art: You put it- you put it on an episode before you started in- in a weird time jump move. 
Austin: Right, right. But this will be the first one that actually hits the-
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: -the feed which is weird. 
Art: Right there is still like, the horrible chance that they’re gonna go terribly wrong, and that we’d- [Jack laughs]
Austin: Believe...Believe me. I've done nothing, but think about that even though I already have that job now. Just like. ‘Oh, all this is gonna fall apart obviously.’ So, check me out there,  Giant Bomb. I have a big piece going up tomorrow that I would appreciate some- some eyes on. What about you, Art? Where can people find you? 
Art: They can find me on twitter @atebbel. And they can read stuff I write at comicmix.com. I think my review for spy went up to today. 
Austin: Awesome. Nick, where can people find you?
Nick: Uh, my name is Nick Scratch. [sing-song] You could find me at nickscrat.ch.
Austin: Ba-dah. 
Nick: Spells Nick Scratch. 
Austin: Ba-dah-bom. Ali, where can people find you on the Internet?
Ali: Uh, you can find me @ali_west on twitter.com. 
Austin: That's a good one. Uh, Dre, what about you?
Dre: Hey, you can find me on twitter.com/swandre3000. 
Austin: Rad. Jack?
Jack: Uh, you can find me on Twitter @notquitereal. And I just released a game today called ‘Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald’. Which-
Austin: Aww, which is such a Jack name. It’s so good.
Jack: Can’t play unless you've backed our IndieGoGo which is finished. So, this is more, I guess, sort of either… [Austin laughs] check your inboxes or in maybe a week or two, look to see if anybody's posted a video of it online?
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: [laughing lightly] Aw..
Jack: I don’t know. I just released a game, and I'm excited about it.
Austin: It’s good. I'm glad. And Keith, where can people find you?
Keith: You can find me at runbutton.net or youtube.com/runbutton. You can find my Twitter @keithjcarberry. And you can find my voice in that game that Jack was just talking about. 
Jack: Keith was very funny. 
Keith: Thank you.
Art: Eh. [Jack, Art, and Austin laugh]
Austin: Thanks everybody for joining us. Thanks again to Jack for all the music that- that he made for the show over the year.
Jack: No problem.
Austin: And thanks to Keith and Nick, both did editing-
Nick: Yeah. 
Austin: -duty over the last couple months. It was tough to figure out the aesthetic of this thing because we didn't just want to release an actual play podcast that was like all the other ones, where it was just like, four dudes sitting in a room like, talking into one microphone, which is what most of them sound like. We really wanted to up the aesthetic quality and make it have a sound that- that contributed to the overall tone and feel. And we hope that with our mech game it- we’ll be able to capture that same thing. It sounds like we will. I think that's it? 
Jack: Are we good?
Austin: I think we’re good. 
Jack: We gonna clap?
Austin: Yeah, we should do a clap. 
Ali: Oh.
Art: Oh, god. I've already-
Austin: Are we? 
Dre: We can do this. 
Austin: Wait. Wait, can we?
Dre: We can do this. 
Austin: Wait, wait, wait. 
Art: We get like-
Dre: The whole season is how we get this moment. 
Art: Could we just like, count what our time.is says cause mine’s like- I'm always way ahead. 
Ali: Forty-four. Forty-five. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: Forty-five. 
Austin, Ali, Keith, Dre: [simultaneously] Forty-six. Forty-seven. Forty-eight.
Art: Ok. Ok.
Dre and Jack: [simultaneously] Forty-nine.
Art: Wait, wait, wait. 
Dre: Fifty. Fifty-one. 
Art: Everyone- Wait, wait, wait. Every- Hm. 
[Jack de Quidt’s “Eve’s Light Parade” begins playing the background] 
Art (continued):  Cause I'm at like, fifty-four. Fifty-five. Fifty-six.
Keith: Yeah. Yeah, that’s it.
Ali: Yeah. 
Keith: You’re counting exactly on time. 
Art: Alright.
Austin: I’m not anywhere near ready.
Keith: Okay 
Jack: I don't know. Also, I guess, in our defense anybody who's ever tried to play live music with somebody over Skype realizes that there is a weird Skype delay- 
Dre: Yeah. 
Jack: -even on a call that can break- It sounds fine in conversation, but it breaks precise moments like, ‘everybody clapping at the same time.’ 
Keith: Yep. A clap is a very short noise.
Ali: Uh hm. 
Austin: There it is. I got it. Sort- sort of.
Jack: If that delay wasn't there, Keith and I would absolutely have done live versions of music on- [laughs] 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: - on the show before. 
Austin: You’re good. Let’s do this clap. What second are we gonna do the clap at? No, forty’s  too soon.
Art: Forty-five. 
Dre: Forty-five? 
Ali: Fifty. 
Austin: Wait, now I’m not sure.
Dre: Forty-five. 
Art: Forty-five. 
Austin: Forty-five. 
[five claps can be heard]
Keith: Nope. We needed that five seconds. We needed that five seconds. You guys didn't let it happen.
Austin: Alright, let’s do it at thirty-eight- Thirty-eight is the one. Ready? This is the one. Everyone…
Ali: Thirty-eight? Wait. Oh, ok. 
Austin: Yeah, yeah. 
Jack: Yeah. 
[Three beats of claps can be heard]
Austin: That was alright. 
Ali: Yeah. [Jack laughs]
Austin: Alright.
Ali: I was hoping we would finish this and do our like, first perfect clap to end this-
