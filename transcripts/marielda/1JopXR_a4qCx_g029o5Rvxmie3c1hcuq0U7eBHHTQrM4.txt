A Message From Austin

Transcribed by: Jaz

AUSTIN: Hey everybody it's Austin. I'm just writing — that's what I'm doing right now, I’m writing to tell you — I'm not writing at all, I'm speaking, I'm speaking to tell you that there will not be a full episode this week. Instead we are going to take this week off. We might take one more week off, I'm not sure when or where. The big reason for that is that I'm launching a video game website at Vice. You might have known I've been the Editor in Chief of Vice Gaming, vice.com/gaming. We are now launching Waypoint, which will go live on noon of October 28th and the way we're doing that is with a big 72-hour live stream marathon with me and my entire staff, which includes Patrick Klepek and Danielle Riendeau. And that's taking a lot of my time, let's say. (laughs) 

It's also probably why I'm sick, because I'm working nonstop. Ummm... but I wanted to take this second to thanks to all of you for listening and for all your great support. It's been fantastic over the last little mini-season that we've done. I wanted to thank obviously the members of the show, especially Ali Acampora who you can find on Twitter @ali_west and Jack de Quidt, who you can @notquietreal find on Twitter, for doing so so so much to make this show sound incredible. Ali is the producer and Jack does all the music. But also I want to thank everybody else. Sylvia Clare, who's @captaintrash, who you can find on Twitter @captaintrash, Andrew Lee Swan, Dre, you can find him on Twitter @Swandre3000. 

And then also the people who did the fantastic world-building at the start of the show back in the quiet year game. And you can find them on Twitter too, I just need to look at where their names are. Uhhh… I can just say the ones I know off the top of my head… let’s see… Janine Hawkins who joined the show this season. You can find her on twitter @bleatingheart, B-L-E-E-T-I-N-G, heart. Uhh, Nic Scratch, who you can find @drevilbones. It looks a little like it says “drevil” bones. Keith J Carberry, who you can find @keithjcarberry, and Art Tebel, who you can find on Twitter @atebbel, T-E-B-B-E-L. Thanks also for our fantastic cover art by Craig Sheldon, you can find that at - our friend him @shoddyrobot, like a robot that’s not put together too well, it’s a little shoddy I guess. 

What else… I wanted to shout out the great unofficial Friends at the Form, a fan form which you can find at fatt, F-A-T-T, dot proboards dot com. Is that… is that it… thanks to everyone who’s been doing fanstica art. It’s apparently - apparently it’s inktober right now, so if you look at the Friends at the Table hashtag or if you search for Friends at the Table or other permutations of that, you’ll find a ton of really fantastic art that people have been doing. A lot of it’s blown me away. A lot of it’s been a different take… there’s an artist named Rho, I believe, who — their work is like — has a scale to it, a sort of a scale and an atmosphere that you don’t see in a lot of the fanart that’s come through so far. I really appreciate that. It’s just been fantastic, the support is great. 

Looking forward, as a heads up, the next two episodes, when they do arrive, will be a little special. We’re designing them as a way for you to catch up or to remember what we did in season one. Season one has some rough audio quality issues, so we wanted to find a solution for how to get people caught up. So it’s a little bit like a clip show, but there should be some new stuff in it too. (clears throat) So definitely take a listen for that. 

And then will be rolling into Dungeon World again, back to Hieron, from season one,where we will see what’s up with characters like Hella and Hadrian and Fantasmo, which some of you may have heard mentioned for the first time in the intros to the Marielda mini-season. A lot of people wonder if we’re doing a Marielda post-mortem because a lot of the questions we would get about the state of the world, or what this meant or that meant, or this theme or that theme, are really tied tightly with some of the things we’re going to explore in the next full season. In the sense, you could think of Marielda as a prologue for the Season three proper, which again, will be back in Hieron for a great Dungeon World game. I need to remember how to play Dungeon World. I think you roll two D6 and everything else comes from that. 

Thanks for listening. I’m gonna go rest my voice, because it’s bad. It ain’t good. (half-laughing) And I’m going to go watch a website I guess. So please check that out too. So you can find me on Twitter @austin_walker and you can follow my website @waypoint on Twitter. I don’t know if I said the name earlier. The name of my website is Waypoint now. Yeah, I did, I must have said it before. So yeah.  Check that out. There will be a pinned tweet there explaining when and where the marathon stream is going to be. I’d really appreciate if you dropped in and made some Friends at the Table jokes in the chat so I got to laugh and you know, that'll make my very difficult weird day better, Thanks everyone. Peace.
