A Message From Ali
Transcribed by @KatieDiek

ALI: Hey everyone! Hi. Hello. This is Ali, your producer and favorite cast member, probably? If not, that’s fine. That's fair. You might notice by the length of this episode, and the fact that there’s no music, and the fact that I’m alone, that this is not a proper episode of Friends at the Table. Yeah.. we’re really sorry! Austin is really busy. Austin is like, the busiest person right now. He’s launching a website? And it turns out that that takes a lot of time and energy. Like, a LOT. Like, even more so if you’re doing something wild like doing a 72-hour stream to celebrate that launch. Yeah, god, you don’t need me to tell you, but you should probably check out that Waypoint stream? It’s going to be from noon October 28th to noon October 31st, and I can personally promise you that it’s probably be pretty good. I can tell you one little secret? I think it’s a secret? Runbutton is going to be joining that stream. So you can watch Keith and Austin… and Kylie play some games together. And Keith and Austin are like, 20% of Friends at the Table? So that might as well be a new episode right there. There also might be some actual play stuff on that stream? I don’t know. I know the dude bought some board games, and that he has some stuff in the works, so you should definitely check it out! It’ll be very good and fun and Austin would definitely appreciate the support. So, yeah, you can check that out on Twitch.tv/Waypoint - I believe right now you can find Waypoint at Waypoint.zone? I guess you could also use the hashtag #Waypoint72 to “join the conversation” on that one. (Ali laughs) I’m sorry, I had to look up where the stream was and I saw that and I had to publicly own Austin a little bit, but anyway - yeah. 

It isn’t a new episode, and we’re really sorry! We’re still going to be doing two weeks of Season 1 recaps, just to get everyone up to speed. They’re going to be really good! I have put a TON of work into them sofar, and Jack is off somewhere learning a new instrument, and Austin has like, a lot of writing and a lot of recording to do for it? And he is so busy! He is the busiest boy. But they're going to be really great. I promise you, on my life and my heart and my soul that one of them, the first one, will be next Thursday. Or something - some actual content will be here next Thursday. I will make sure that there is! But, this week is another off week. I’m so sorry! 

Thank you, everyone, for your support and your patience, and we will definitely, absolutely see you next week! In the meantime, you can still follow the show @Friends_Table on twitter. You can also find the show at Friendsatthetable.net which has, the show and the maps and some character bios. It also has some links and information to all of the games that we’ve played on the show - I don’t think that I’ve ever mentioned that on air but yeah, I have links there for information and where to buy every game that we’ve played on the show, which is a lot. Some might say too many but I would say just enough. So, yeah! Check that out. Play some games, have some fun. In the meantime, we will see you next week for sure, for sure, for sure. Good night everyone - or good day, whenever you’re listening to this, whatever it is, make sure it’s a good one.
