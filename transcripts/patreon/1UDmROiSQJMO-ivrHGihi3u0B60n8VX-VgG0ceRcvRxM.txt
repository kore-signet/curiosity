Bluff City 04: The Cost of Greed Pt. 2

[MUSIC (The Cost of Greed by Jack de Quidt) PLAYING IN BACKGROUND]

AUSTIN (As Hector Hu?): By now, listener, you’ve read the holy canons. But have you read Charles Dickens? Have you read William Shakespeare? Have you read Abraham Lincoln? Hardly a saint between them it's true, but there is a wisdom there, shared by these thinkers, these ad hoc holy men. They each ask us to strive to be, quote: “The better angels of our nature”. But which angel specifically? One of the good books talks about Cherubim and Seraphim, rulers and powers. But it calls only three angels by name. Gabriel, the messenger, deliverer of truth and prosperity. Michael, the warrior, who leads godly armies towards justice. And of course, brightest star of all, Lucifer. Son of the morning, light bringer, the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble. The man who made the world a wilderness. He who wished to ascend above the clouds, who believed he could set the world right. Which, listener, is your better angel? For me it’s easy. I’m a Gabriel, I tell the world the truths they need to hear whether they wanna hear them or not. But if you’re not a Gabriel then you walk a thin line. You’re caught between being a Michael, a holy soldier, and a Lucifer, who sees only the strength of sanctity in a mirror. You out there. You do-gooders. I see you, moving between light and dark, helping those caught in the shadow. You walk careful now. I have seen others fall. And once you are cast out, there ain’t no comin’ back.

We just --I went to a game store the other day and was just like, I wanna buy all these games and play them in Bluff city, so..

[Ali and Sylvia laughing]

ART: I was gonna say like so, it’s a good thing you’re here at Bluff City when its still reasonable. But we’re, we’re fighting ghosts today.

[Ali and Austin laughing]

AUSTIN: We are. Well! 

ART: Well-

AUSTIN: Y’know, maybe not ghosts, we keep sayin’ it.

ALI: Maybe not ghosts. 

AUSTIN: I feel like that should maybe be the [laughs] the motto of either your business or the Trenton Terranormal investigation unit. Maybe? Maybe it’s not ghosts? Jake was giving a, a confession to a confessional recording and I don’t remember what he was saying.

ART: No me neither but I th-, I think it was a really good, like, cliffhanger.

ALI: Oh it was spooky you were like [impersonating Jake] If I’d found out what I’d found out then, I would have also wanted to wash up [uncertainly] onshore.. somewhere else or something?

AUSTIN: Mmm mhm, okay so-

ALI: It was like, very spooky.

ART: I don’t know, I hope it was that, that’s great.

[Austin and Ali laughing]

AUSTIN: The thing-

ART: I never remember things I say in this game.. 

AUSTIN [quietly]: Yeah me either.

ART: ..people always have to be like remember when you said this? And I’m like no, but that’s great. Did I say that?[Austin and Ali laughing]

AUSTIN [incredulously]: Me?? Are you sure?? [speaking normally] Here’s what I do remember is-

ART: You put him in my path, you know what I do. That’s, that’s awesome, who said that?

[Austin and Ali laughing]

AUSTIN [sarcastically]: Yeah, he doesn’t remember, fuck off. [laughs]

[Art and Ali laughing]

AUSTIN: To bring us back up to speed though. So it was the week before labour day, the last big holiday of the summer season. And Lenny and  Black, Millennium Alexander Black, who revealed himself to be one of the, the major investors in Gresand Paranormal, called you in and basically was like, its time to show whether or not you’re worth my investment, like not only in terms of fiscal but also in terms of like community driven change and like helping people and meaning something to the city. And then the.. the case that he put you on was that the Menagerie which is a, a hotel and casino run by the Veranda family, closed off one of its entire floors. And upon investigation what you found was a security guard named Louis Puma who, who after some prodding told you that the the.. slot machines upstairs kept winning even when they weren’t supposed to. And, and there was some other thing too, what was there? A smell? Was there a smell?

[Ali, Art and Sylvia all speak at the same time]

ALI: There was a sweet smell, yeah.

ART: Yeah baked goods.

SYLVIA: Yeah sweet smell.

AUSTIN: It smelt like baked goods. Upon investigating you ran into Trenton Terranormal Investigation who are kind of your out of town rivals. And after interacting with them [laughs] “interacting with” being euphemism for Jake fucking one of them up [laughs]. You.. learned -What else did you learn? You learned that there was...

SYLVIA: It’s like a weird sea creature.

ART: It’s a, it’s a -It was a leprechaun right?SYLVIA: We thought it was a leprechaun.

AUSTIN: Well, you saw a foot. You saw a foot, you saw a toe. You recorded a toe.

SYLVIA: It was a weird green foot.

AUSTIN: During the scuffle, yes.

SYLVIA: Yeah.

AUSTIN: You recorded an image of the foot.

SYLVIA: It was like a weird, green aquatic thing.

AUSTIN: Yes.

ALI: Yeah.

SYLVIA: Is what we -Like, we found a, a, we found an old newspaper that had like blurry picture of it, I think?AUSTIN: Yes.

ALI: No, we found-

SYLVIA: Or..? 

ALI: ..it was like an old like Irish folklore book about a legend that like this, this town had destroyed this monster and it disappeared. And then like a newspaper form like two week ago that was like, this body washed up on our shores, and we don’t know what it is-

AUSTIN: Right.

ALI: ..and its like a weird sea-thing.

AUSTIN: Its a weird sea-creature  and also millenials are killing Bluff City [laughs].

ALI: Yeah. Mhm. Yeah.

SYLVIA: Forgotten about that part.

AUSTIN: Another important detail, well two other important details, one it was also the door -The Menagerie is connected to the Black Colossus, which is one of the casinos owned by Millennuim Black. And it, the door that connects the two, thats -So there’s like a sky bridge that connects the two. And one [laughs] its a ridiculous sky bridge that is also an aquarium, it has like an aquatic like big tank i guess, aquarium tank i guess like around the sky bridge.

ALI: Ohh yeah. Mhm.

AUSTIN: Two, it is, the doors were hot and cold to the touch. When -On the Millenium Colossus side. SO those were all the big points that I remember. And as a-

ALI: Theres a few more, I have them written down;

AUSTIN [excitedly]: Oh, please!

ALI: So everything I have writ down is, Menagerie shut down its floors on Labour Day. Sky bridge that connects the Menagerie to the Colossus is shut down. Hearing footsteps on sky bridge. Hot and cold doors. Nothing on cameras, doors are locked. No Colossus employees allowed. Machines keep winning.

AUSTIN: [laughs] Oh, also phones. Cause remember you tested gotcha games.

ALI: Oh yeah yeah yeah, exactly. Yes. And the, the like, our like machine thing also had a false positive?

SYLVIA: Ohhh.

AUSTIN: Well, I mean, I don’t remember if it was a false positive or not.

ALI: I just, I’m not sure if it was the result of a good roll or a bad roll, but like it, it was supposed to like make a smoke wherever there was like paranormal things happening-

AUSTIN: Mhm.

ALI: ..and it just filled the entire floor. 

AUSTIN: Yes, it was, it was specifically, the thing I said was like, the luck on it was also maxxed out. And so like it was looking for a hit and it got the biggest hit possible and it smoked out the entire second floor. And you had to evacuate? You had to flee. It set off a fire alarm I think, maybe? You guys left in a hurry, for suresies.

ALI: Yeah we left.

ART: Didn’t it like-

SYLVIA: It, it had like a bunch of smoke and I think a smoke alarm went off.

AUSTIN: THAT is what I think happened.

ALI: Yes, yeah, we, we, okay, ‘cause we were doing the dry cleaning thing.  There was that whole dry cleaning bit?

AUSTIN: Oh, right, you got soaked, right, you got soaked, yes.

ALI: Yes.

ART: Yeah, yeah, with the pizzas.

AUSTIN: Also pizzas, okay, we’re back up to speed.  It has not been as long as you might think it has been since we played, but…

ART: It has been like, eight days.  

ALI: It feels like twelve years.

AUSTIN: It does, it has, this past week y’all.  Jesus, alright.

ART: [deep exhale]

AUSTIN: Um… so…

ALI: Ah-

AUSTIN: Go ahead.  

ALI: I was gonna say I had like a shot that I wanted to open up on, or like a question about the rules (AUSTIN: Totally!), ‘cause I left last game feeling bad that like, two adults left this chi- injured child [laughs] and didn’t do anything about it, Sylvia’s character Sid like, sprained their ankle last game.

AUSTIN: Aw, right.

ALI: Um, and I was like “that’s kind of fucked up”, so I thought, like, I don’t know if there’s like, a mechanic in this game like a healing mechanic to get them that-

AUSTIN: That stress back, yeah, right.

ALI: Or to at least open up on a shot of like, either like, Sid trying to hide their injury and Alexa being like “oh my god, sit down!” or like, helping her bandage it or whatever.  

AUSTIN: Right… There is a way to get stress back, but I don’t think it’s a thing you can do in the middle of a story.  (ALI: Okay, fair enough) I’m double-checking, gimme one second to double check, ‘cause I don’t wanna get this wrong.  

ART: So instead we open up on a shot of Jake being like “I once wrestled a sixty-minute broad way with my ankle all the way broken, iunno what your problem is, kids these days.  Grrrr…”

[ALI and SYLVIA laughing]

AUSTIN: Um, so, I’ve looked it up, and there is not as far as I can see a way to recover stress, but what there is is if you end up getting any cool points, and no one’s gotten any cool points yet, you can resist stress.  

ART: How dare you! [laughs]

AUSTIN: And you get cool points by rolling well, really well, on stress.  So, y’know.

ALI: Okay. 

AUSTIN: Maybe you’ll get some soon.

ALI: But there’s no player-to-player, like, help you out kinda thing… 

AUSTIN: Not that I can see.

ALI: Alright, fair enough, I didn’t think so, but still.

AUSTIN: So what is the scene you wanna open on?

ALI: Um, I think it’s… I don’t wanna direct too much of it but it’s either like, them in the office like, preparing to leave again, 

AUSTIN: Is it the same, like, day, is it the next day, is it… has anyone gotten coffee from the coffee machine?

ALI: Maybe it’s later that night… [laughs] oh coffee, oh lord, um, I think it’s probably later that night, I feel like maybe they… did like a daytime investigation, like talk to the people kinda thing, and then now that the sun is setting, they’re like “Oh, we can really get some work done now”, um, I don’t know what that is, but…

AUSTIN: What the work is?

ALI: Yeah, but I feel like having a night investigation would be fun.

AUSTIN: Um, there is, you guys have, the only person in the office right now with you, it’s you three, and then there’s also Orville, Oriville Olenbach, who is the receptionist, he, uh, he’s just, um, what’s the actor’s name from, who played Harry Crane, what is his name, he was also in— 

ART: Rich Summer.

AUSTIN: Yeah, Rich Summer.  Uh, it’s him in his most, like, nebbish, like, has on a bow tie and a vest and he, he looks like an usher in a movie theater, basically (ART: Aww…), and he works nights here, and he’s like

AUSTIN (As Orville): Cmon, gimme some, gimme some coffee, cmon… Hey guys, the coffee machine isn’t… it’s not listening to me, it took three of my dollars.

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Yeah, it’s been havin’ one of those days.  [sighs]

	ALI (As Alexa): What kind of coffee are you ordering?  

	AUSTIN (As Orville): A ca— uh, mm, a cappu-latte.

ALI (As Alexa?): [snorts], well, first of all... anyway— 

	AUSTIN (As Orville): It’s the third button, it says cappu-latte.

ALI (As Alexa): I, yeah, that’s your taste and that’s fine, but sometimes if you try like, if you order like a decaf, and then you try a different one, it’ll come out.  I have an extra dollar.  

	AUSTIN (As Orville): [defeated] Mmkay...

ALI: Um, and I guess I like, go over and try to [laughs] go do the thing, like beep beep.  Um, our coffee machine is haunted, that’s important, right?  

AUSTIN: Yeah, this is what he means when he says it’s not listening to him.  (ALI: [laughs] Okay…) It like, takes your dollar, and then it spits out a different dollar with a different year on it.

ALI: Oooh… What year is it?  

AUSTIN: What, uh…

[ART and ALI laughing]

AUSTIN: 1989… like…

ALI: Is this, is this significant?  

AUSTIN: I dunno!  This happens all the time, and some— here’s the trick, it is sometimes significant, and it just like, doesn’t… sometimes it puts one out and you’re like “Ooh,” you spend like a whole day tryna crack the case, and then when you go back, it just has another dollar hanging out like it’s, like, sticking its tongue out at you, and the lights on it make it look like it’s winking at you while it’s doing it, so… sometimes it just fucks with you, is what I’m saying.  

ALI (As Alexa): Listen, coffee machine, we’ve had a really long day.  You saw us in there with the… Jake didn’t even have his shirt on, he was eating pizza, Sid is hurt, can you just like, for the one time, please?

AUSTIN: Um, it like, it makes… it’s like “bzzzzz, bzzzzz” and then it spits out the three dollars that Orville had put in, um… and then before Orville can put a cup down, it just starts spitting out, like, the cappu-latte mix.

SYLVIA: Great.  

AUSTIN: And Orville’s like “uh!” and like grabs a paper cup and puts it under, and gets some, some cappu-latte.

ALI: I give Orville his money, I give the machine like a little pat.

	AUSTIN (As Orville): T-thank, thank you.  S-So what’re you guys working on? 

	ALI (As Alexa): It’s like, kind of a sea mission, sorta thing.  Um...

AUSTIN (As Orville): Oh… I… like, A B C, like it’s kind of like a third tier, like not a very important one?

	SYLVIA (As Sid): No, like the wet one.
[ALI laughs]

	AUSTIN (As Orville): [whispered] the wet one, wha… 

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Ocean.

	AUSTIN (As Orville): Oh, like the ocean!

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Yeah.

ALI (As Alexa): Y’know, right next to the beach, you’re gonna get some sea monsters.  I’m really excited, I haven’t done one of these yet.

AUSTIN: [laughs] Said like someone who’s like, unlocked a new mission type in Fortnite.  

[laughter]

SYLVIA (As Sid): Wait, so you, we, we’re based out of a seaside town, but you guys haven’t done a sea monster before?
	
ALI (As Alexa): Well they’re rarer than you would think.  We mostly get… Mm, Jake what would you say that we see the most?
	
ART (As Jake): I mean, I would say most of what we get is people who don’t understand their electronic devices.

AUSTIN: [laughs]

ALI (As Alexa): Lotta that…

ART (As Jake): I would say second most is apparitions slash poltergeists.  Third most is a land-based… creature.

ALI (As Alexa): Lotta land based creatures, some sand monsters actually, but not a lot of directly in the ocean sorta things, so I’m really excited.  

AUSTIN: Orville’s like— 

	AUSTIN (As Orville): [sigh] It all sounds very messy.  I’m gonna just go back to the… front desk.  Good luck!  If you need anything I’ll be here.  Me and the coffee machine.  

AUSTIN: And he goes back to the— 

	ALI (As Alexa): We can always count on you. 

	AUSTIN (As Orville): Yeah, [sniff]

AUSTIN: I think he’s like, in the middle of a game of solitaire on a Windows 98 machine at the front desk.  

ALI: [laughs] Alright, I have two ideas.  Do we want to go… to the beach? [laughs]

AUSTIN: Beach episooode!

ALI: Just fuck around investigating on the ocean somehow… Um, [laughs] figure that out when we get there, or do we want to go to that other casino? 

ART: Well, the casino’s near the beach.

ALI: [crosstalk] Or is there like a museum in town?

AUSTIN: Hmm?

ALI: Is there like, museums?  

AUSTIN: Iunno, you tell me.  

ALI: I feel like that would be more like, investigative stuff though, I wanna get like, messy.  

SYLVIA: [laughs]

AUSTIN: Right, so I guess I should restate that part of it is like the structure of this game at this point.  Um, in general, the way that the game progresses is you go from getting the call, which you’ve done, then to research/investigation, which is where you come up with possible explanations, then in step three is where you suit up, you get the right equipment to take care of the problem, then four is field work, you travel to the scene and deal with the problem.  Once the agents have earned enough job dice, they uh, and they can’t earn more, or they can’t earn more, uh, but that’s how you end and like, make more franchise… bucks or whatever.

ALI: [laughs]

ART: We should go… we should go to the Museum of Maritime Oddities.  

AUSTIN: There it is.

ALI: Yeeeah!

AUSTIN: Uh huh.  Uh, where is that at?

ART: I think… that the Museum of Maritime Oddities started as a boardwalk attraction, and it was real popular.

AUSTIN: It’s like a Ripley’s Believe It Or Not style?

ART: Yeah, like a Ripleys, but they, they, they fell on some hard times, they had to relocate, now they’re like four blocks deep off the water, but they’re still tryna like have that same kind of vibe, but like the place next to them is like a Walgreens.

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: Right, right, they have like, signs up all around the neighborhood trying to point you to the Museum of Maritime Oddities, yeah…

ART:  Yeah… “Just 50 feet this way!”

AUSTIN: Hm hm, alright.  We can just jump to y’all being there.  Do you pull up in the van?  In, in, Sid’s dad’s van?  Or do you just walk there, like, what’s the… oh, you take a jitney, do you take a jitney?

ALI: … What is that?

ART: A late-night museum jitney?

AUSTIN: Oh man…

ART: Oh, a jitney is like the worst bus you’ve ever seen.

AUSTIN: Aw, y’all don’t know about jitneys, I forgot about jitneys until this moment.

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: They’re such an important part of Bluff City, um, and of, everything?  They’re such an important part of life.  I guess they’re also called dollar vans, which is not as fun to say.

SYLVIA: Oh, okay, I know what this is.  They’re like, uh, they’re like airport shuttles kinda.

AUSTIN: Right, except that like, what if you lived in a city where this is what the bus service looked like.

SYLVIA: Yeah, totally.

ALI: Ooooh, huh…

AUSTIN: Um, like I used to get into New York with these when I lived in north Jersey actually.  Um, but Atlantic City for real has a bunch of jitneys that go through, through town, um, and then there are also traditional busses that take you out of AC, and into like mainland south Jersey, so I imagine it’s the same thing with Bluff City, where like, the jitneys run down the two main, like avenues, that cut down like, close to the ocean, and then busses would take you like, off shore, basically.

ALI: So is it like… it’s like 9:30 on a Tuesday, no one is on this bus, we are waiting at whatever the jitney stop is, and like, with all of our equipment?  

AUSTIN: Are you?  I dunno, or are you just taking the van?

ART: No, I don’t, we don’t have all of our equipment, we’re just…

ALI: Enough that it’s comical, I would think. [laughs] I think we should at least have the like, um…

SYLVIA: Got the camera!

ART: Aw, I think it’s, it’s kinda funny if it’s like the two of you with a reasonable amount of equipment and then Jake just has like a giant backpack.  

[laughter]

ART: Like, back, y’know, hiking backpacks, just like loaded with junk.  

AUSTIN: Mmhm, got it.  Okay, so, you get onto the jitney, you’re the only one there, it drops you off, you still have to walk, ‘cause it’s like, it’s not on the jitney route, like it’s not even on the jitney route, you can’t even take the fucking jitney to the Museum of Maritime Oddities, um, but you’re able to walk there, and then you like, show up, and the first thing you notice is that the lady who is the receptionist here is wearing the same outfit that Orville was wearing, and maybe you put two and two together and realize that maybe Orville just is using his old, uh, Museum of Maritime Oddities uniform, still.  

ART: [laughs]

AUSTIN: He thinks that’s what it means to be like, y’know, a… just a receptionist, or like a greeter in any, in any job.  Uh, and the second thing you notice is that it says “Closes 10:30pm”, and it is like 9:45 by the time you get there.

ART: Oh we’re members, so they’ll understand.

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: Are you, waitwaitwait, are you members?  If you’re members— 

ART: Yeah.

ALI: [crosstalk] On the list…

AUSTIN: Alright, that means you have to give me a technology roll.  This is gear.

ART: Oh… um… Hmmm…

ALI: [laughs]

ART: You’re sure it’s not contact?  [laughs]

AUSTIN: I think contact would be not being a member and being like “hey, give us a discount’.

ART: [distant] Alright, I’m rollin it.  

AUSTIN: I think so.  

ALI: Is it something that Sylvia can—

AUSTIN: Aah, y’know what, maybe it’s contact.  It’s contact, it says your list of, of contacts you can call for advice, support and assistance.  I’ll say this is contact.  This isn’t gear, it’s… it’s like an association.

ALI: Yeah, yeah.

AUSTIN: Um, and remember that you can use your franchise cards too, if you ever need to roll more.  You don’t, ‘cause you got a fuckin’ six, so.

ALI: Yeeeah!

ART: So does this count as, oh, this doesn’t count for our franchise score.  

AUSTIN: No, it doesn’t, but it counts— uh, it could, depends on what you give me, what are the two facts that lead to solving the case?  So, describe to me, you get in, the receptionist is like

	AUSTIN (As Receptionist): [sigh] Alright, guys, I’m staying until eleven and that’s it.

AUSTIN: Um, and then like, y’know, you ask for access to the back secret room, and she’s like

	AUSTIN (As Receptionist): Alright, I’ll let you into the back secret room, but that’s it.  

AUSTIN: And then she’s like

	AUSTIN (As Receptionist): Alright, three cups of coffee, but that’s it!

AUSTIN: So yeah like, tell me two facts that, like, I guess kind of describe this additional investigation, Art.  

ART: Um, okay…

AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Museum, what’s it look like in here?

ART: Oh it looks like, it looks like… the saddest, PT Barnum-iest thing you’ve ever seen, right?  It’s like… but there’s some real stuff here, but there’s a lot of like, y’know, there’s an exhibit on the Loch Ness monster, and there’s like, y’know, there’s probably an exhibit on the creature of the black lagoon that’s just been there for like, fifty years now, right, and when did that movie come out?

AUSTIN: Right, and it was like a tie-in to the movie, like, it was always fake?

ART: Yeah, it’s like that dude, yeah, yeah.  But then there’s like, some real stuff, there’s uh, y’know, there’s some sand monster material here that we know is real, and there’s, uh, but then there’s also like, the plaque that’s like “Jersey Sand Devil”?  But I think, it’s in poor repair, right, the, y’know, the paint’s not very fresh and the, the exhibits are definitely like, pre 80s in terms of interactivity or anything.  Nice gift shop though.  

AUSTIN: So what do you find?  What’re the two facts?

ART: The two facts…

AUSTIN: That directly lead to solving the case?

ART: Y’all feel free to pitch any fact ideas you have.

ALI: [laughs]

ART: Um… I mean I think that it’s easy if there’s just like, what if there’s like an exhibit about that, that uh, newspaper article, right, the one from…

AUSTIN: Right, like they’re the only ones who, who, like their owner saw it in the news and was like “We gotta get us a uh, a new exhibit on the thing that was just in the news!”, and then the kids are like, who work there are like “No one c- no one cares.  No one cares about the sea creature, like, [sigh]”.  But it’s there, there is an exhibit.  What do you learn from the exhibit?  Is it also just like, the exhibit has a big blown-up picture of the picture that was in the newspaper, to where you can even see—

ART: I think that’s like, literally all it is, so we can see more detail, and alright, like we see…

AUSTIN: Or maybe they have the original picture blown up in a higher quality now, so you can figure out something else.

ART: Mm.  Yeah.

ALI: What if it’s like, one of those like, y’know those three fold, um, like science project things, like those boards that you put up [AUSTIN: Yeah! Uh huh.] with a bunch of like, fact cards and whatever?  Um, there’s gotta be something like, it’s gotta be a whole display with like, some stuff we can kinda pull from it.

ART: Yeah… What was the name of the, what was the thing we had?

SYLVIA: The like…

ALI: Uh, Selkie?

SYLVIA: Oh, the selkies and kelpies were the two things, which, it’s great that they rhyme.  

AUSTIN: It is great that they rhyme!

SYLVIA: Uh, were the big things that I, suggested after we finished recording, because I had like, a weird, nebulous idea of both of them when I described the weird sea creature thing.

AUSTIN: I don’t know anything about either of them.  

SYLVIA: So, I can do a quick like, explanation, if you guys want.

AUSTIN: Please!

SYLVIA: So, selkies are kinda the most straightforward one they’re like— 

AUSTIN: Also, wait wait, can you do this as the, the receptionist to this place, whose name is Olive, her name is Olive August.SYLVIA: Alright… okay [sigh].

AUSTIN: She has a very, like, oval shaped head, and um, she also has big round glasses, and her is like, parted down the middle and then ties into a ponytail in the back, and uh, she has on like, a sweater vest, and it is the fucking summer, but it is, she does not like wearing it, she’s constantly like, it’s scratchy and she’s pulling at it as she talks. 

SYLVIA: Alright.  And she like, she’s like, uh, she’s itching, like at her neck while she’s pulling out like, a notepad from her pocket, and she like, flips through it for a bit, and she’s like 

SYLVIA [As Olive]: Alright, let’s see, selkies are an Irish fairy, um, that, uh, on land take human form but can, but shed a skin of a seal, and wear that and turn into a seal, sorry, my handwriting’s a little…

AUSTIN: [laughs]

SYLVIA: And she’s like, adjusting her glasses and she’s like

SYLVIA [As Olive]: Yeah, so they’re like, naturally seals, and then they come on land and it becomes, their seal fur becomes a coat, and then when they put that back on, they become seals again, in the, in the ocean, is this one…

	ALI [As Alexa]: Oh my goodness!

AUSTIN: [laughs]


SYLVIA [As Olive]: And then, what was the, what was the other one you, guys wanted to know about...

SYLVIA: And she starts flipping through again.

[three way crosstalk]

ALI: Uh, something with a K?

ART: Uh, kelp.

SYLVIA: Get it was the other who’ve, the other Irish thing…

ART: Kelpie.

ALI: Or just kelp.  That might help.  

ART: I don’t think it’s kelp.

AUSTIN: [laughs]

SYLVIA: She’s just mumbling to herself, she’s like mumbling a bunch of names to herself, like you hear like, um, uh, what’s it called, you hear like “chupacabra” under her breath for a second while she’s looking through.  

	ALI [As Alexa]: Not that one.

SYLVIA [As Olive]: Uh, kelpie, kelpie, um, also from the Irish region, it’s uh, a shape, another shape-shifter, weirdly enough, uh, this one is a, tends to be an aquatic horse, of some kind, and then can take the form of a human, but it can apparently just shapeshift into whatever, is, what i’m reading…

ART [As Jake]: Now, do you mean like a seahorse? Or do you mean a horse in the water?

SYLVIA [As Olive]: No like a…  like a…

SYLVIA: And I can’t do this, like Sylvi can’t do this, like, straight up physically at all but she like, neighs.  Do like, a horse noise?

AUSTIN: [neighs] 

SYLVIA [As Olive]: Like that, like that type of horse.

	ART [As Jake]: Mmm…

SYLVIA: And Sid gives her a thumbs up when she does that.  

AUSTIN: Heh heh, she gives one back to her.  They’re probably in school together, in retrospect.

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: Like they’re the right age to be…

SYLVIA: Oh yeah no, like, i was gonna say Sid’s been here a bunch, because her girlfriend works at the Walgreens next door, so she knows Olive pretty well.

AUSTIN: [laughs] Yeah… Olive definitely asks you for a cigarette before you leave.  

SYLVIA: Oh definitely, I give her one for sure.  I give her two, ‘cause I know it’s been a long day, and she helped us out.

AUSTIN: Mmhm…

	ALI (As Alexa): How old are the two of you?

	SYLVIA (As Sid): 20… ugh…

	ALI (As Alexa): Okay… that’s bad… anyway, does it say anything about like, luck?

SYLVIA (As Olive): Uh, not specifically, but there’s a lotta stuff tied to irish fairies that has to with that particularly, I mean the most common one’s leprechauns obviously, but that whole ecosystem seems to have weird tricksters and luck related things from what I can tell here.  

	ALI (As Alexa): True...

AUSTIN: Uh, is this like, did you, is this a thing you’re committing to learning here, or is there something else?  

ART: I mean, we definitely learned that, I don’t, you can’t take that away from us— 

AUSTIN: Yes, but are the like— 

SYLVIA: But is it, like, a point towards the investigation?

AUSTIN: It should be, what, I mean like, being here should give you some insight into what you’re, what you’re, even if it’s like those things are dead ends, and now in fact you have a different direction, um…

SYLVIA: Like, I think the stuff we could take away from this is like, a common trend of shapeshifting sea creature.  

AUSTIN: So it’s probably a shape-shifting sea creature, that’s definitely one, I like that.  

ART: What stops a shape-shifting sea creature.  

AUSTIN: There you go, that’s a good question.

ALI: You steal its coat.  She just said you take the coat!  When they put the coat on, they turn back into a seal, we just have to find a coat.  

AUSTIN: And put it back on.  

ART: Y’know, don’t we want it the other way, don’t we want it to keep being seals?

ALI: Oooh…

SYLVIA: Well I mean, it…

AUSTIN: Well no, because if you put the, if it has the coat off, it’s a person and it’s on the land, and if you put the coat back on them and put them back in the water, then they go back to being a sea creature.

ALI: Mmm…

ART: I wonder what’s brought em’... brought em’ on land here…

AUSTIN: I wonder if they even know where their coat is.

ART: I thought they wore the coat.

ALI: Yeah, but if they take it often, turn into a person, a gal, whatever, and then they lose it, someone steals it, so they, y’know, you go to a restaurant, you leave it on the, the, I do this at Friday’s all the time, I leave my coat on the back of my chair, then I have to go back there the next day to get it, umm, y’know, it happens!

00:30:00

ART: That’s how they get ya.

AUSTIN: Like, what if she made a bad bet, and she lost her coat? 

ALI: Oooh…

ART: I don’t think they let you bet your coat at the casino.  

AUSTIN: Honey, it’s Bluff City, you can bet anything.  

ALI: A seal coat would make you a pretty penny…

AUSTIN: Or maybe she brought it to a pawn shop, or a… like a cash for coats…

ART: [laughing] A cash-for-coats?

AUSTIN: Y’know, a cash-for-coats… I think we just get a cut-in of some ridiculous local celebrity doing like, 

AUSTIN (As Local Celebrity): Welcome to Cash For Coats!  You got coats, we got cash.  You gotta be up late, playin’ the dice, and you don’t need a coat on to do that!  You bring your coat down here to Cash For Coats, we get you settled, we’ll even give you chips directly.  Take it from me, Chip Directly!

ALI: [laughs]

ART: Oh, that should be against the law…

SYLVIA: There’s um, I have like a very specific guy in mind for this, he’s like, a local, um, Ontario-based cash for gold guy [AUSTIN: Uh huh] called Oliver Jewelry.

AUSTIN: Jesus CHRIST.

SYLVIA: Yeah.

ART: No, that’s not real.

SYLVIA: I will, I will link it.  

AUSTIN: I’m about to watch it, I’m super excited.  

SYLVIA: There’s, I’m gonna link his Scatman parody.

ALI: [gasps]

AUSTIN: Aw, I see it.  Oh, he’s British.

SYLVIA: Yeah, Russel Oliver.  [ART: Woah!]  Sorry, Oliver Jewelry’s not his name, it’s his company, but I always thought it was his name.  

AUSTIN: It’s a good name.  Oh, this is so bad.  

SYLVIA: It’s real bad.

AUSTIN: Oh my god.  

ART: What on earth…

ALI: Wowee…

SYLVIA: [laughs]

AUSTIN: That was really bad.

SYLVIA: It’s really bad.  

ALI: Wow…

ART: It helps that Canadian money is so colorful.  Anyway yeah, Chip Directly, fine, we have to figure out what he’s famous for, but…

AUSTIN: Yeah.

ALI: You’d think with all that money he would buy a better idea. 

AUSTIN: [laughs]

SYLVIA: Eh, I mean, his catchphrase is “oh yeah”, I don’t think he’s a very creative man.  

AUSTIN: Um, alright.  

ART: Alright, so, I guess that does sound like we got two points.  

AUSTIN: Yeah!  Alright, I’ll raise it, 8.

ART: Gotta go to a Cash For Coats.

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: So there are three Cash For Coats in the city.  Um, one of them is out on like the, so there’s two big avenues that run through, that run kind of parallel to the ocean, do you know what I mean, so basically run like, north-south along the length of Bluff City’s, the island that Bluff City is on.  I guess I could talk a little bit more about the way Bluff City is set up in this moment, I’m gonna just open up a new tab and just very broadly draw this.  Um, let’s see, so… in my ha- in my hand, in my head, Bluff City is something like, so what I’ve drawn here is kind of three land masses, there is a big long, like, island, that runs north-south, there is kind of a land mass that is out to the west of that, and there’s another little land mass to like, the north of that… I’d actually move this some, but, basically there is a big north-south land mass that is Bluff city, plus some additional, um, townships, or like other towns.  I think there’s probably another one there… Uh, and so like the big one to the north is Bluff City, and then there’s like these two long streets that go down the entire length of this island, that are like the main avenues, like that, and then like, Bluff City is pretty dense, and there are casinos all through the like, right up against the water, obviously, um, and then it kinda becomes residential, to the north, kinda like the mid-north of Bluff City is kind of residential, and then the further north you get it’s like— I just wrote north, good [laughs]— then the further north you get, it becomes, like, the fancy part of Bluff City, where it’s like, the marina, and that’s where like, the fanciest casinos are.  And then everywhere else around it is like, various rich people live there, rich or like upper-middle class, basically, all of the other little towns are all just like, various degrees of wealthy, and then you get onto the main shore, and that’s where like, the people who really work in the casinos live, is out on the mainland, basically, and so uh, the three Cash For Coats, one of them is right in like, the heart of Bluff City, like right up against, like up on the boardwalk directly, there’s one that is the, like, original one, which is right where residential hits, the kind of southern part of Bluff City, the kind of more casino heavy commercial area, that is kind of like, run down a little bit, and there’s not so much local investment there any more, and so that was the original Cash For Coats, and then there is The “Original” Cash For Coats, and “Original” is put in quotation marks, and that is near a new, like, off-shore, kind of like, away from the boardwalk, new set of like big shopping, like a big shopping plaza, that the city has been investing in heavily, which is like, there’s a bunch of outlet stores, and then there’s some fancy restaurants, and then there’s also The “Original” Cash For Coats, which is not the original Cash For Coats, but it is there, like that is what they’re trying to pass it off as, even though everyone remembers when it opened two ago there, tourists don’t know any better.  Uh, so which, where are you going?  

ART: I feel like the real original is the, is our best shot, I dunno though.

AUSTIN: For what it’s worth, I don’t know either, rolls are going to help figure that out, because that’s how this game works.

ALI: Yeah…

ART: Maybe it’s the boardwalk one?

ALI: Yeah.

SYLVIA: Close to the ocean.

ART: Close to casinos and the ocean.  [ALI: Yeah] Yeah, let’s, let’s, let’s, yeah.  

AUSTIN: Aight.  

ALI: Can I do a confessional real quick before we change scenes?

AUSTIN: Absolutely, [ALI: Cool] I’ll bring us back over to that, that um… 

ALI: Yeah, thank you.  Um, that’s gonna be, we don’t have our van, right?

ART: We do.

AUSTIN: We do.

ALI: So it’s, um, Alexa like, sitting in the back of the van, and there’s some noise outside ‘cause you guys are, well, I shouldn’t be so specific with the time, um, but, she looks kinda grave and she’s like

	ALI (As Alexa): Y’know, I didn’t expect them to understand because I, I’m aligned with myself in a way most people aren’t, and I [sigh], my Jupiter moon is, y’know, misaligned right now, but still, I felt, I knew it had to be done.  When I saw that coat, I knew I had to destroy it.  

AUSTIN: Oh my god… Good, great.  

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: I just wanted to do a quick reminder about this too, which is that confessionals can also give character traits to other players, um, and character traits are like, they can produce more franchise score points in the long run, which, y’know, we’re not doing like an ongoing Inspectres game, but if we were, that would be a really cool way to get extra franchise score, which again, I don’t think we’ll come back to this game?  But… it’s something to think about, ya know?  Uh, alright, so then do we just jump to inside of Cash For Coats.

ALI: [laughs] Why not?  

AUSTIN: Okay!  So, you get to the boardwalk, um, the boardwalk Cash For Coats, tell me, uh, what’re you doing here, what’s the, I guess I can give you a little bit of what it looks like, which is, it is open until midnight- no, no, it’s on the boardwalk, it’s open all night, because they want you to come in and sell them your coats for chips, but it’s the w- it’s also in some ways the worst one, like, the one to the north, the one that’s like, near the residential district, has a sort of pawn shoppy charm, in that like, the people who go there are legitimately, like, from bluff city, right, and the stuff you’d find there, as this sort of like, coat-based pawn shop, are like, um, it’s stuff that people who live here would pawn, basically.  Uh, the one in the big shopping plaza is fake as fuck, because it is only really attended to by out-of-town shoobies who come in to, to, like, for the, just like for the experience, like, the sort of people who would go to that pawn shop from Pawn Stars, would go to that, you know what I mean? [ALI: Laughs] Which is like, there’s a degree of like “oh, it’s a big pawn shop, they have fancy stuff there, they have like, Bruce Springsteen’s third guitar”, and so like, that’s what that is, it’s almost like its own mini museum.  This one is, like splits the middle in the worst way, in that the people that come to this one don’t live here, they are tourists who come to town and then need to sell their coats in the middle of the night so that they can go back to the betting floor.  Um, they are, they’re also the people who are here to go to the beach, and who like, didn’t bring sunscreen, or who, y’know, for whatever reason, maybe they by mistake lost a bunch of money, and now they need to sell their hats to get the bus fare back to, to Pennsylvania, and are also just like, looking for souvenirs, and so there’s lots of fake, there’s lots of stuff that is not, like, fancy, and is not from people in Bluff City that is just like “Bluff City Original T-Shirts”, like you can buy, you could buy a t-shirt that has a coat on it, like a tuxedo t-shirt except it’s a coat, and on the back it says “The Real The “Original” Cash For Coats Coat T-Shirt”, and on the front it’s a fake, it’s just like, it looks like a peacoat or something, and then there’s a little fake pin that says “I came to Bluff City and only got …” and then underneath in parenthesis it says “see back”, and…

ART and ALI: [laughter]

AUSTIN: And that’s the sort of place it is.  Yes it’s airbrushed, thank you Sylvi, yeah, lots of airbrushing here, lots and lots and lots of airbrushing.  Sylvi in the chat, um… so yeah, that is what you see, um, and, you do see good ‘ol Chip, uh, Chip Directly, in the, behind a glass case inside, and it is playing, it is playing like, a top 40s mix of music from 15 years ago, um, so, there’s that.

ALI: It’s like bulletproof, not that he’s stuck, right?  [laughs]

AUSTIN: Oh nonono, he’s behind a glass, sorry when I say a glass case, I mean like a glass cabinet, like a low glass counter, he’s not, but it’s not bulletproof at all.  

SYLVIA: [laughs]

ALI: Sorry, sorry, I just...

AUSTIN: It’s opening, no it’s fine.

AUSTIN (As Chip): I’m in a case, hey!

SYLVIA: Did you think they had him on display like in a museum?

AUSTIN: Yeah.

ALI: [laughs] That’s why I was like “oh my god!”

ART: I also thought that, it was weird.

AUSTIN: Alright, fuck it, he’s in a glass case!

SYLVIA and ALI: [laugh]

ART: He’s like, talkin’ to people, like “hey, how are ya, Chips Directly”

AUSTIN: [crosstalk] He hits a button— 

ALI: [crosstalk] He’s got like a hamster tunnel that he walks over to the cashier, like, till, too.

AUSTIN: Yeah, he hits a button and like, bends a little mic, like a dispatch microphone over and it goes like [nasal] BAH and he goes

	AUSTIN (As Chip): How you doin’, welcome to uh, Cash For Coats.

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: What’re y’all wearing?  Do you guys have good coats on? Oh, we’ve actually already seen that Jake has a big Undertaker coat, right?

ALI: Yes.  

ART: Yeah.  Just a big Undertaker coat.

AUSTIN: BAAH

	AUSTIN (As Chip): Twenty two, twenty two dollars.

	ART (As Jake): This is a, this is legitimate memorabilia.

	AUSTIN (As Chip): What kind?

	ART (As Jake): What kind, I am the avatar of Anubis!

AUSTIN (As Chip): Aight, we speak American here, buddy, what, uh, can you give me a little bit more?

	ART (As Jake): [sighs] I was the mid-atlantic champion!

	AUSTIN (As Chip): Of what?  Are, like, water polo?

	ART (As Jake): Water polo… you think there’s regional water polo leagues?

	AUSTIN (As Chip): The world is big, I, you know, I, s-surprised every day.

	ART (As Jake): I was a grappler, a fighter, a wrestler.  

AUSTIN (As Chip): What, like the pride, the K1, like a kickboxer, you like, an Ultimate fighting champion?

	ART (As Jake): N-no, not like that.  

AUSTIN (As Chip): What’re you, like a boxer?  What’re you, like a… whadda you, you do those underground fights down at the...

AUSTIN: And he hits a different buzzer and it gets quieter.  Bzzz

	AUSTIN (As Chip): Down at the bowling alley?

	ART (As Jake): [sighs]

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Wait, there’s boxing at the bowling alley?

	AUSTIN (As Chip): Don’t worry— 

AUSTIN: Hits a third buzzer, bzzz

	AUSTIN (As Chip): Don’t worry about it kid.

	ART (As Jake): No, like, like they do up in New York.

AUSTIN: And he, bzzz, bzzz, BZZZ, goes back to the high one

	AUSTIN (As Chip): Oh you mean pro wrestling?

ALI: [laughs]

	ART (As Jake): I don’t do anything amatuer.  

	AUSTIN (As Chip): Twenty-one dollars.  

SYLVIA: [laughs]

ART: Jake pounds his hand on the glass.

	AUSTIN (As Chip): Aaay!  That glass is worth more than your coat!

	ART (As Jake): It ain’t, and it ain’t for sale.  

AUSTIN (As Chip): Oh, I’m just, I’m kidding with you mister, uh, Anubis, don’t worry about it, I seen you wrestle, it’s good, you do the whole thing where you lift, aaah, then you climb the ropes and you do, graaah, 

AUSTIN: And he like, opens up his hand like graaah, and lifts his hand up and does like a chokeslam motion, and then just shakes his hand a bunch.

	AUSTIN (As Chip): You’re a pro, I give you a deal, yeah, thirty-two dollars for that coat.

	ART (As Jake): I’m not tryna sell the coat.  I have, I have a good job and I’m cold.

[everyone laughs]

AUSTIN (As Chip): We could do a trade-in, we can do a trade, we’ll get you, I mean it’s a long coat, I can give you a peacoat for a trade-in equal value, I could give you a, I could give you a rain jacket, you would look stellar in a rain jacket, you put a little uh, rain hat on you, we reaff, re, bring you back into the ring, and now you’re the Rainmaker!

SYLVIA (As Sid): Think that’s a thing.

AUSTIN (As Chip): Is that— it’s ‘cause I came up with it, if it’s a thing already, I got franchise wrestlers, you heard about wrestling franchises?  I got a whole new thing I’m working on class franchise wrestlers, we take em out, we put em in all the different programs in all the different federations, and all of the association, and also in all of the different operations, we do those here in Bluff City, we do those overseas, we do those all throughout the world, and then the hope is it’s like rollin’ the dice, you roll a lotta dice, some of em are gonna come up, ah, seven!  So...

ART (As Jake): I think New York’s been doing that with the clown for a while now.

AUSTIN (As Chip): Aww… I don’t wanna talk to you about that clown.  Who’re your friends, these your kids?  What’re these?

ART (As Jake): They’re, these are my coworkers.

ALI (As Alexa): We’re business associates

SYLVIA: [laughs] Sid just like, Sid just stars cackling when, uh, that question is asked.

AUSTIN (As Chip): Ah, the business associates, that’s good!  The business associates, nothin’s scarier than big business!  Are you like, they’re doin’ like a womens league now I guess, huh?

ART (As Jake): Look… I’m not still in the business.  I got my own business now.

ART: And Jake takes out his business card for Gresand Paranormal Director of Operations, and puts it up on the glass.  

AUSTIN (As Chip): [inaudible whispering] This is high-concept, I don’t think this is gonna play.  This is not… sorry, i don’t think this, I can’t get into this one.

ART (As Jake): You went from really outside to really inside.

AUSTIN (As Chip): Oh sorry, [BZZZT bzzzt bzzt] I don’t think I can get into this one, this is-

ART (As Jake): That’s not what I meant, no, that’s not.  

ALI and Austin: [laughter]

AUSTIN (As Chip):Oh, you meant like, not outside/inside voice, [bzzt bzzzt BZZZT] you didn’t mean outside/inside voice, you meant like, y’know, listen I’m a businessman, they do business, and you got, I want you to tell the, hmm, okay, look me in the eye and, and, you been in the business a long time, right?

ART (As Jake): Yeah.

AUSTIN (As Chip): The wrestlin’ business that is, the wrasslin’ business, it used to be the wrasslin business, it became the wrestlin’ business, you ever find out when that switch came?  You ever notice? It USED— 

ART (As Jake): I think it sorta crept down, I think in some, some parts it’s still the, still the other one.  

AUSTIN (As Chip): Nah, for a little bit.  Just wait though.  ‘Cause what I did is I introduced coats.  To wrestling.  

ART (As Jake): I don’t— 

AUSTIN (As Chip): Used to be you came out, you were in your leotard, you were in your unitard, you’re in your various, uh, hmm, you were in your various outfits, and that was it, you were in your wrestling outfit, you were in your trunks, you were in your tights.  And then I said “Hey, hey Billy, put a coat on, you walk to the ring in a coat, people think, ha, hwah”

ART (As Jake): Who’s… I think Gorgeous George was the first person to wear a coat, and I’m sure—

AUSTIN (As Chip): No, it was Beautiful Billy!  Gorgeous Geor— My lawyers assure me… [ART: [sighs]] that was a robe.  There’s a difference between a robe and a coat.  

ART (As Jake): [quietly] Okay… 

AUSTIN (As Chip): Anyway, I’m glad to see a real professional and his two darling children here.  Um, what can I, if you’re cold I can get you, but again, group deal on the coats—

ALI (As Alexa): We’re not children!  We’re here for business, sir.

AUSTIN (As Chip): I’m sorry, I’m Chip, I’m Chip Directly, Business Sir isn’t in.  Ay!

ALI: [laughs]

	ALI (As Alexa): We’re looking for a coat.  You’ve wasted enough of our time.

AUSTIN (As Chip): Well you c- Okay you came to the right, you came to the right place!  Look around!  I got coats that are coats, I got t-shirts that are coats, I got boots that are coats.

ART (As Jake): You’ve got boots that are coats?  

AUSTIN (As Chip): I got boots that are coats, put ‘em on, you’ll feel warmer, check it out.  

SYLVIA (As Sid): These are just crocs.

ART (As Jake): That’s not…

ALI (As Alexa): Those are really nice, actually, [AUSTIN: See?] are they like the real ones or the off-brands?

AUSTIN (As Chip): Mhmm.  

ALI (As Alexa): That’s…

[laughter]

ART: Weird how many future Bluff City games are gonna need coats.  

[more laughter]

ALI (As Alexa): Ch- uh, Chip, have you gotten any coats recently that are, um, like, especially, um… extravagant?  And warm?  

AUSTIN (As Chip): Uuuh, like, like a jean jacket?

ALI (As Alexa): No... [laughs]

ART (As Jake): That’s, that’s none of the things she said.  AUSTIN (As Chip): Aaah… Like a windbreaker.  

ART (As Jake): What’s extravagant to you?  You own a coat store!

AUSTIN (As Chip): Yeah, and I’m, I’m very frugal, okay?  I didn’t get to own three coat stores ‘cause I took the good coats home, eh?

ALI (As Alexa): Okay, so like think of like a fur coat, but instead of fur, it was like… um, a seal, I’m just gonna say it, like a seal, have you, do you have any seal coats?

ART (As Jake): Seals got fur, right?

AUSTIN (As Chip): Nah, I don’t, I don’t mess with that guy, really didn’t lie the song in the Batman thing.

ALI (As Alexa): Um, that’s an incredible song, I think that we should leave, but— 

[laughter]

ALI (As Alexa): I am so committed to, ugh, the spiritual integrity of Bluff City that I am not.  

AUSTIN (As Chip): Oh, you want a very— 

ART: He puts his hand on Alexa’s shoulder and is like, 

	ART (As Jake): Look, it’s okay… [ALI: [laughs]] He’s wrong about the song.

AUSTIN: [laughs]

ALI (As Alexa): It’s just, it doesn’t make any sense, it’s so good, that movie was so good, [ART: I know] I love him and Heidi Klum, it just doesn’t... [deep breath]

ART (As Jake): He stands in a case all day, don’t worry about him.  

AUSTIN (As Chip): Hey, I sit back here sometimes too!

ALI (As Alexa): Sir, have you encountered any strange coats lately?

AUSTIN: Give me a roll.  

ALI: [laughs] Okay, so a contact roll.

AUSTIN: Yeah, this is definitely a contact roll.  Uh, and again, remember, you can use your library card, your gym card or your credit card here, if you want to— actually you can’t, you can use bank, you can’t use any of the other ones.  

ALI: Yeah, my contact is already like, maxed out, so, it’s just a 3d6 roll?

AUSTIN: Okay, alright, yup, 3d6, take the top.  There’s a 6!

ALI: Ye-yuh.

AUSTIN: Hell yeah.

AUSTIN (As Chip): Alright, alright, alright, alright.  Okay.  We got a coat in, we uh… it was uh, very fancy, by your standards, I guess?

ART: Wait, aren’t we doing this wrong again?

AUSTIN: Oh yeah, we are, we are doing it wrong again. 

ALI: I’m supposed to give the detail, but you can do the, the monologue.

AUSTIN: I’ll do the setup, which is— 

	AUSTIN (As Chip): We got a coat in, which was fancy I guess?

AUSTIN: And then I dunno, what’re the details?

ALI: Um, what’re the details.  I think the details are that he was a little thrown off because it’s actually like a really thin material [AUSTIN: Ooh, okay] um, it’s more like a housecoat almost, and I think that it feels like, really heavy.  Like, like you hold it and it looks fine, but when you kind of put your arm, like your arm or your hand inside of it, like it weighs you down like a lot, like you’re wearing one of those like, like iron lungs or whatever.  Um…

AUSTIN: Is… Is either of these things why, uh, Alexa decided to destroy this thing, or is that just a side… dealie.

ALI: Um, I think it is, ‘cause I think that it, like, that’s probably really painful, or like, feels like torture, um, like… I think that it’s...

AUSTIN: Interesting.  Like it’s that heavy, it’s that, okay, I gotcha.

ALI: Yeah, yeah, I think that it’s like a very, like a, like a, yeah.  So I think that she like, kind of puts her arm into one of it to like, kind of feel how magical it is, I guess, and when she does, there’s an immediate, like, pain, like pushing down on her.

AUSTIN: Yeah, so, so I think when you describe it, and like, I think he hits another, he goes like 	AUSTIN (As Chip): Alright, gimme a second.  

AUSTIN: And then goes like bzzt bzzzt BZZZT bzzzt BZZZT and like, hits the same three buttons but in a special order, and then like, a, you know what it is, it’s the same technology that you saw in Millenium Black’s apartment, where like, part of the wall folds in and a track on the ground rolls out and then, you know, but instead of being chairs, it’s now like, a hangar set with a, or there’s like a bar that comes out too, on the track with coats hanging from it, and it’s all very rare coats, it’s like, it turns out this is where his secret stash is, um, and, there are probably like six goof gag coats in here too, righ.  Um, everybody pick a gag coat, what’s a funny coat.

ART: I dunno, but we shouldn’t use all six of ‘em, we should leave some for future people.

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: Alright so, that’s a good point, we each get one, and there’s more than six.  There’s in fact, there’s a, it goes like BZZZT, brrr, and then the gag coats start coming out, and then they keep going across the entirety of his store, and then like, just when it’s about to hit the other wall he goes like bzzt bzzzt BZZZT bzzzt, and another hole opens on the side so that it keeps going through the other side of the whole store, and it’s just like bzzz, and a whole rack of coats just rolls past, it’s like a laundro— it’s like a dry cleaner.  Um, and then finally he stops it and pulls down one, and it’s the seal coat.  Or maybe a robot takes it down, he doesn’t take it down, he’s behind this, he’s behind this glass, right.

ART: Robots work here?

ALI: It’s like the Yotel arm that just like, is like “bwoop, here you go”

AUSTIN: No it’s— yeah, it’s a big arm, thank you, yes, it’s a robotic arm, that actually no, it like, it takes it off the hook, and then puts it on you directly, Alexa, and that’s when you feel it.

ALI: Oooh, yeah yeah.  

AUSTIN: Um, you feel it and like, maybe you also feel a call to the sea, right?  Like maybe it’s like, this terrible thing where you can feel your will being suppressed.  ALI: Yeah…

AUSTIN: And he says, 

AUSTIN (As Chip): Alright, that’ll be three hundred dollars.  Uh, we got installment plans, you could pay us back, if you like that way, we got, we can put it on layaway, you know, holidays comin’ up and whatnot.  

	ALI (As Alexa): Um, so we do need this for the good of the city.  Uuuh, so I think the 
price should be able to be negotiated.  

AUSTIN (As Chip): Yeah, agreed, you wanna pay me four hundred dollars, the city gets another 20% or whatever, and then it’s good the city, ay!

ART (As Jake): ...What?

AUSTIN (As Chip): Taxes, kid, keep up.  

ALI (As Alexa): What price are you willing to pay on your, um, spiritual integrity, sir?

AUSTIN (As Chip): Haha, uh, haha, ooh, I’m all paid up sister.

ALI: [laughs]

SYLVIA: Hmmm…

AUSTIN (As Chip): I go, I go ‘round Saint Micheals every Christmas, every Easter, every uh, every uh, festival of the saints whose names I can remember… Saint Theresa… is she a saint yet?  Did she, did she get the sainthood?

ART (As Jake): I don’t think so.

ALI (As Alexa): Um, I think that’s like a process…

AUSTIN (As Chip): Saint Micheaaal!  ‘Cause that’s the name of the church, I remember that one.  Three hundred dollars, it’s three hundred dollars, it’s three hundred, it’s three hundred, that’s the price it is.  Frankly, it’s a steal, I could put this out in the, uh, in the plaza center, aaaah…

ART (As Jake): I dunno, if you thought you could sell it, it’d be out here.  

AUSTIN (As Chip): I just…

ALI (As Alexa): It’s a good point, why wasn’t it out here?

AUSTIN (As Chip): Alright, ‘cause I only like to sell certain quality things to certain quality people.  It’s about relationships, now you know, the next time you need a heavy seal coat, boom, I’m your guy.  I, these, these tourists who come through, they don’t need a seal coat.  

ART (As Jake): How many people come in looking for seal coats?

AUSTIN (As Chip): You’d be surprised.  

ART (As Jake): I would be.  

AUSTIN (As Chip): I wanna, I wanna unique souvenir.  I used to put things like this out on the racks, and then joe schmoe from the big city comes in, and he says “oh, little billy, love this one”, and then he buys it and he takes the little billy and it turns out to be, uh, y’know, a situation where little billy ruins it, and the I have to hear about it on the news one day.

ART (As Jake): What?

AUSTIN (As Chip): The boss only had one first coat, and it’s been ruined!

ALI: [snorts with laughter]

	AUSTIN (As Chip): It was his baptism coat.

ART (As Jake): Did you say Bruce Springsteen’s [AUSTIN: Yeah…] first coat was a seal coat?

AUSTIN (As Chip): No, I’m sayin, special coats!  Inside of the category of which, seal coats are one type of special coat. 

ALI (As Alexa): You didn’t even know this was a seal coat.
AUSTIN (As Chip): Ah, well, I may have been holdin’ this or that back a little bit.  But you got me— 

ART (As Jake): He has a very workin’ man image for a seal coat.

AUSTIN (As Chip): No, I’m not saying the boss had a seal coat!  It was linen.  Anyway, three hundred dollars.

ALI (As Alexa): Seals wear linen too.  

AUSTIN (As Chip): Oooh, kay.

ALI: [laughs] um…

	AUSTIN (As Chip): You read that in a crystal, like what’s the…

SYLIVA: Hmm hmm.  

AUSTIN: To buy it, it would be a technology roll, for sure.

ALI: Um…

AUSTIN: Oh, also, wait, you put that coat on, you need to roll stress, roll one stress.

ALI: Yeah, I would love to.

AUSTIN: No, nonono, roll two stress.

ALI: Okay!

AUSTIN: There is like a supernatural thing happening here.  It would have already been one stress if it was I’m wearing what might be the skin of another creature, that you know is alive and walking around still, but when you feel that it’s the supernatural pull, that’s two stress, so gimme a, gimme a roll.  

ALI: 2d6?

AUSTIN: 2d6, uuuh, and I don’t remember if you take high or low, let’s see.

ART: It says the lowest die is used.  

AUSTIN: Oh, there you go, so, whoof, that’s a 2.

ALI: Twooo…

AUSTIN: That’s ain’t good, um, so lose two dice from the appropriate skill or one die from two skills.

ALI: [pained noises] Ooh, ah, ooah [laughs], um, oh, okay, this is gonna make this scene easier.  So I’m gonna take two from my academics score, I am also super stressed out, and I don’t like this guy, and I don’t have three hundred dollars.

AUSTIN: Well, you roll technology to see if you have three hundred dollars.  

ALI: Okay, but, 

SYLVIA: Oh, I know where this is going 

ALI: I think what I would prefer to do [laughs]

AUSTIN: Oh no…

ALI: Is to [laughs] maintain eye contact with Chip while I hold it in my hands, like by the collar, and I just tear it in half.

AUSTIN: Give me an athletics roll.

ART: [scoffs] Do I have to take the confessional token to do just like an Office look at the, like eyes bulging looking at the camera, like?

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah, definitely, uh huh.  ‘Cause I want that in the confessional booth, I want that, I want like, the cutaway to Jake just like…

	ART (As Jake): Whaaat?

AUSTIN: [laughs]

ALI: Can I, um, can I pick up one of our gym points for this to get me a 2d6 as opposed to 1?

SYLVIA: [laughs]

AUSTIN: You sure can!

ALI: I would like to, thank you.

AUSTIN: I’m gonna spend that gym card, you have no gym points left now, boom.  

ALI: Thank you, we can get them back, it’s fine, and that’s a 6.

01:00:00

AUSTIN: That is a six.  All right!  Um, what happens?

ALI: [laughs} Okay, I have to say—

ART: I mean, we’re already up to 10 with just our…

AUSTIN: Mhmm!

ALI: Okay, um, so I think that when it pulls in half, there’s like, there’s that sweet smell again, from the casino, it kinda fills the room as soon as it like spreads open, and I think that like, I don’t think that it like, it frays the way that you would expect it to, instead of ripping like a silk, like, actual coat would, it like, the edges of it seem like they’ve been like, burned.

AUSTIN: Oooh.  Alright, my question there is like, how do those help you solve the case, so not just two things about, like… push a little bit further there.  

ALI: I think maybe, hmmm…

ART: What if it… What if it knows?

ALI: Yeah, I was gonna say, like, we either start hearing like, a siren song, coming from like, whatever direction, maybe towards the casino or whatever.  

AUSTIN: Ooh, yeah.

ALI: Yeah, I think just hearing this, I was gonna say maybe our like, computer machine goes off, but I think that’s way more interesting if we just like, hear a voice coming from that casino now.  

AUSTIN: Oh, what if, waitwaitwait, what if you get a phone call from Orville, at that exact moment.

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: And he’s like, 

	AUSTIN (As Orville): Hey, you, you guys should turn on the radio!

AUSTIN: And that’s actually like, it is a song, it’s exactly that, but it’s like, playing out on the radio on every radio station.  What’s the song sound like?  

ALI: Um, I think that it’s like… it’s a siren song right, so it’s like kind of in, um, indistinguishable but it sounds like, attractive?  Like it’s trying to like, guide you to a place, I think it’s kind of like mellow, like it’s obviously not like an upbeat, like [laughs] “I’m a weird sea monster” tune.  But I think it’s like a, kind of a sweet voice at a like a lower tone than you would expect, and like I think that even though it’s on every radio station on every channel, like almost like the coat was trying to pull you to the sea, I think that it’s like beckoning us to a spot in town.

AUSTIN: So is it like, is there something in the lyrics that bring you to the town, or bring you to a certain place?

ALI: I think it’s just like a feeling.  

AUSTIN: And it’s a feeling, okay so is it a feeling that only you have, because you ripped the coat?

ALI: Uuuh, yeah.

AUSTIN: Or is it like, okay, so it’s not a situation where everybody in town is… yeah yeah yeah.

ALI: Yeah, ‘cause I don’t think that like everyone goes, yes yes yes, is like “oh yeah, gotta go to the Menagerie or whatever” [laughs]

AUSTIN: Right, is that where it’s pulling you to?

ALI: Um, I will take suggestions there, that’s kind of where we set up the, the first scene, so I feel like it should be, but if you think that there’s somewhere else that this sea monster could have ran off to by now…

ART: Maybe it’s in the walkway, that’s why…

SYLVIA: Yeah, I like the…

ALI: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Totally.  Um…

ALI: Oh, we never did get in there, yeah.

AUSTIN: No.  I like a shot of like, as you’re going back— I, so you’re going back, I guess?

ART: Well we gotta gear up.

AUSTIN: Oh actually, what happens is, um, fuckin’ Chip is like

	AUSTIN (As Chip): Excuse me!?

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN (As Chip): You wouldn’t rip up three hundred, crisp hundred dollar bills, you wouldn’t rip a three hundred dollar coat!  You owe me.  I’m gonna collect one day.  Greysand Paranormal and Anubis, an-and family. 

ALI (As Alexa): You owe me, sir, your family, and your children, and your lifeline, and this town are gonna thank me.

AUSTIN (As Chip): For rippin’ a coat?!? What? Wha?

ALI (As Alexa): For maintaining the spiritual sanctity of Bluff City.

	AUSTIN (As Chip): Whya you— 

ALI: And then she throws it on the floor and like, walks out.  

SYLVIA: I think, um, right before she throws it on the floor is when they notice that Sid has already left, like she ran off the second that thing got ripped in half and is like, starting up the van.  

[laughter]

AUSTIN: God… you like, pull up on the boardwalk to do the pickup?  Alright, good.

SYLVIA: Yeah, yeah, also she’s wearing a hat that says “world’s greatest dad” that she accidentally stole from, uh, from the store.

AUSTIN: Good, “accidentally”.  

SYLVIA: Yeah, accidentally, listen… it was a panicked moment.  

AUSTIN: Uh huh.  

ALI: I would love for her to have like, left behind the camera because she like, scrambled to get out so for the rest of that scene it’s like, on the floor on the side. [laughs]

SYLVIA: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Uh huh.

SYLVIA: Like, when they play it back there’s just a shot of like, it falling to the floor, and then of Sid like, limp-running out, like you see her feet.

AUSTIN: God, and then someone has to grab it on the way out?

ALI: Yeah, it’s, um, when Alexa…

AUSTIN: Everybody gets in the truck, or in the van, and then has to get out, someone has to get out to go grab the, you actually pull away, you start to pull away, then slam on the brakes.

ART: While Jake runs back in to grab the camera, yeah.

AUSTIN: Ah, so good, okay.  Um, so then as you’re driving back through the city streets towards the Menagerie, and the, the uh, the Black Colossus, 

ART: No, we gotta go to the office first, we gotta get our stuff.  

ALI: Yeah.  AUSTIN: Oh, okay, well then as you go to get your stuff, you drive pas- like under the aquarium walkway, and it’s all glowy, it’s all like, bright teal.  Alright, so— 

ART: Can we, can we just have like, a brief conversation about why she ripped that coat?

AUSTIN: Please!ALI: [laughs] In character or out of character?

ART: Yeah, yeah, in character.  AUSTIN: Oh, it better be in.

ALI: [laughs]

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Yeah, so first question Alexa, uh, what the fuck?

	ALI (As Alexa): Um, it had to be done.  I— 

	SYLVIA (As Sid): D-did it?

	ART (As Jake): What?

	ALI (As Alexa): Yeah, it was horrible.  I would not put that on a person ever.  	ART (As Jake): That’s its skin!

	ALI (As Alexa): Yeah, but it’s like, it was bad, it was like really bad, like it felt bad!	ART (As Jake): It felt bad to you!

	ALI (As Alexa): Yeah, I was wearing it!

AUSTIN: [laughs]

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Oh my god…

ART (As Jake): But that, you would feel bad wearin’... You wouldn’t wanna wear Sids skin either, but Sid is great in Sids skin!

	ALI (As Alexa): No, it wasn’t bad like that.  It wasn’t bad like that.  ‘Cause I felt it!

	SYLVIA (As Sid): First of all, Jake, thank you.

AUSTIN: [laughs]

ALI (As Alexa): [laughs] Sid, I, I, understand that you might think I’m a little unhinged right now but I would never wear your skin, and if your skin was cursed, I would rip it up for you as well.  

SYLVIA (As Sid): Oh— [sighs] Do we have— First of all— Okay, so.  First thing is if we, when we, I guess meet this thing, you’re explaining all this to, hey Jake, do we have an HR department?  I think I need to talk to somebody.  

ALI: [laughs]

	ART (As Jake): Uh, yeah, uh, of course we do, um… y’know...

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Is it just Orville?

ART (As Jake): No, it’s not Orville.  You haven’t, who, you didn’t meet Phil when you were hired?

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Nah, I’m lit- I’m basically always with you guys.  

ART (As Jake): I didn’t hire you!ALI (As Alexa): Oh yeah, remember Phil had that day, there was that street festival and he ate all of those… funnel cakes is the word I’m looking for, funnel cakes, and then he was sick that day and we did, me and you did her hiring paperwork.  

	ART (As Jake): Mmm… 

ALI: [laughs quietly]

AUSTIN: Thank you for allowing me to write down “Phil, Gresand HR person, ate too much funnel cake”.

ALI: [laughs loudly]
SYLVIA: Awww, my god...

AUSTIN: Friends at the Table.  Actual play podcast, [inaudible]
ART: You coulda just put like, loves funnel cake.  AUSTIN: Ah, that’s funnier, yeah.  

ALI (As Alexa): I, guys, when I felt that coat, I felt like… there was a reason that person took it off.  Whatever this is, whatever this thing is, it’s bad!

	ART (As Jake): Alright, you better be right about this.  

SYLVIA: Um, I’m just gonna grab the confessional really quick.  

AUSTIN: Oh, please.  

SYLVIA: And it’s Sid, and it’s much later, and then it’s just her looking at the camera and she just says,

	SYLVIA (As Sid): She was not right about that.  

[laughter]

AUSTIN: Good… Oh, no, you can’t do that, you can’t do that.

SYLVIA: I can’t do tha— Oh yeah, I can’t do that, sorry.  

AUSTIN: Yes, you explicitly are not allowed to no, to no, uh, someone’s already established fact.

SYLVIA: You’re right, yeah, my bad.ART: Wasn’t this an already established opinion?  

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: I guess that’s true…

SYLVIA: … Nah, let’s, let’s leave it.  

ART: It’s not like, “my mom was a—” 

AUSTIN: I think it’s the spirit, it is the spirit of the rule.

SYLVIA: Yeah, it’s a good joke, but it’s not good mechanically, so we’ll forget about it.  AUSTIN: No you say it, and then a narrator who we’ve never heard then says “Sid was wrong”.

[laughter]

ART: The narrator gets to…?

SYLVIA: Phil. 
AUSTIN: Uh huh, yeah, well, because the narrator can just say no to reestablish the yes-and.  Two no-ands make a yes-and.  That’s what I’ve always said.ART: Well that’s the, that’s the ghost in the coffee machine right, that’s…

AUSTIN: Yes, that’s.

ALI: [laughs]

ART: Now we’re, now we’re establishing that that voice is Ron Howard, so yes.

SYLVIA: Yes.  AUSTIN: He’s gonna be a tough, tough get when it comes to our HBO special.

ALI: Oh, it’s fine.  

ART: We’ll just get someone else from Happy Days, it’ll just be Henry Winkler.  

[laughter]

AUSTIN: Ah, okay.

ART: Sid was wrong, sit on it!AUSTIN: [quietly] Oh my god…

ALI: Okay, so we’re gearing up?

ART: Yeah.

AUSTIN: You’re gearing up, what’s that look like?

[long pause, sigh and a wheeze]

ALI: What gear do we need?  Can we like, decide more stuff or is it from the stuff that we decided already?

AUSTIN: You can roll technology to decide more stuff.  Which would mean like “oh, hey, this is useful to you”, versus, like you have all the stuff you already have, which is, I’ll go over it again, a carpentry van, walkie talkies that take c batteries, haunted coffee machine, anti-paranormal computer thing, you know, the APCT, and the all-purpose homemade mace.  

ART: We have a twelve on our franchise score b-t-dubs.AUSTIN: Wait, from what, was the… 

ART: We started off with six, um...

AUSTIN: Right, and then you got two at the, at the museum… and then you got two— 

SYLIVA: And didn’t we just get two…

ART: We got two whenever Ali rolled two one and six and we got two when Ali rolled five and six to rip the coat.  AUSTIN: No, no, the two one and six was, oh no, you’re totally right, what was— 

ART: That was the, that was the contact roll for… 
AUSTIN: Okay.

ART: For talkin’ to… Chip, Chip Directly.

AUSTIN: Oh, you’re totally right, that was a contact roll, and then boom, okay.  

ALI: Oh I did— okay yeah.  

AUSTIN: Yeah, totally.  Lotta sixes this game.  Six six, like, three sixes, oooh.

SYLVIA: Mmm!

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: Spoooky. 

ALI: Um, what do we do with the franchise points, spend it for…

ART: We have a— 

AUSTIN: What?  No, you need fourteen to win.  You can’t close the case until you get at least fourteen.  ALI: Oookay.  ART: Are we supposed to be doing rolls in the gear up section, what’s, what’s gear up supposed to look like?

AUSTIN: Ah, it’s whatever you feel like it needs to be, you could totally be doing rolls to get franchise, like, this is a situation where let’s say you had eight franchise score, you would be rolling to get the gear you need to go get the baddie, you know, and so that would be increasing your franchise score.  Um, so you totally could, but we’re still gonna play until it makes sense to end, y’know?

ART: Sure.  

ALI: [sighs]

ART: I mean, Jake isn’t a big technology guy, so he just grabs a big, a big can of his all-purpose homemade mace.AUSTIN: Okay.

ALI: [snorts, laughs] the deluxe can.

ART: And some goggles, so he doesn’t get mace in his own eyes.  

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: Okay, good! Are they like, goggles from an old bit he used to do, an old, an old character?

ART: Yeah, uh, he was, in his very early days he had a pilot gimmick.  AUSTIN: Ooh, okay.  

ART: And then people were like “you’re too tall to be a convincing pilot, like, no one buys this”.

AUSTIN: [laughs] “[deep voice] I fly the tall planes”

	ART (As Jake): The biplanes, the triplanes…

ART: “The cockpit’s the same size in--“

	ART (As Jake): I fly the planes…

AUSTIN: [laughs]

ART: His finishing move at that time was an airplane spin, and that was very impressive back then.

AUSTIN: Good. Different time. Uh, does anybody else gear up, or are you just taking what you got?

ALI: Umm, we should have some extra stuff [SLYVIA: Yeah…], I think that we should have like, a communicator, that would be cool maybe…

SYLVIA: We definitely got like, some kinda walkie talkies.  

ALI: Nononono, like a, like a, like a, like, translator.

SYLVIA: Aaah…

ART: How the hell are we getting one of those?

ALI: We have one in the back office, or something... 

ART: It’s not on our gear list.

ALI: [laughs] Um, I dunno, like maybe we…

ART: I mean, you should roll for it.

AUSTIN: That’s a technology.  ART: [laughs] Can Sylvi’s say “Sid” on it?

SYLVIA: Yeah.

AUSTIN: As “sit on it”, like from… happy days…

ALI: Oh, kay, that was a wild, okay, 

AUSTIN: Sid on it, uh huh.SYLVIA: Yeeeah.ALI: Okay, kay kay kay, um, Sylvi, do you wanna make a technology roll as the [laughs] the only one that doesn’t have a one in technology...

AUSTIN: No, whoever had the idea rolls technology, that’s the— 

SYLVIA: Yep.  I would, but…

AUSTIN: That’s the rule.  ALI: Okay… if you have an idea after this, by all means.  That’s a three.

AUSTIN: Aww, that’s a three, so what was the thing you were looking for again?ALI: Umm, so, I was gonna say that like, is it something new that we have to create, or is it like…

AUSTIN: To translate?

ALI: Yeah.  

AUSTIN: Umm, I uh, it could have been.  Like so, what’s the thing that you were gonna try to do, was it gonna be like a creation thing, was it gonna be like, programming in a new translation… tool into the anti-paranormal computer thing?

ALI: Yeah, but I was gonna say, is it like maybe there’s like a… like another, like a, she’s just using like, the google translate on her phone or whatever, 

AUSTIN: Yeah.ALI: But there’s a way to like… [laughs] look up, like, there’s probably like, a couple youtube videos that show you how to do this, and some websites with the, the code.  But then you can like, program in, um, different ghost languages?  I think I maybe [laughs] try to do that!

AUSTIN: Huh… Uh huh.  Yeah, I think maybe you do it, and also it’s, you get it in Gaelic, because that’s what, it’s Irish, right?  But actually, it’s Scottish Gaelic, is what you needed, and it’s a different, it’s a different, it’s the celtic language that was native to Scotland, so it’s just off a little bit, which means you’re just, you only are able are gonna get, like, a couple of key words, maybe, um… there’s, there’s similarities, but there are gonna be major differences also.  So, uh, and as important as always, you think it was loaded in, you think you got it, perfect.  Um, you think you got it perfect except then like, you type in, or you say like “selkie”, and what you expected to hear back was just like, “seal”, um, but instead, what you hear is, um… what’s a good joke here…

ART: “Water dog”

AUSTIN: Thank you, yes, exactly.

ALI: [laughs]AUSTIN: Yeah, okay, yes, you get “water dog”.  And now I know how this whole joke system works, thank you Art, for figuring out the joke.  

ART: You got it.

AUSTIN: Okay.  	AUSTIN (As Orville): Alright, ah, be careful everybody.  Umm, if you need anything, you          
just, well I’m outta here in two hours, so, uh, good luck, I hope I see you again!

AUSTIN: Big grin.  Uh, and so you drive off to— which side do you go in?  Do you go in the Black Millenium side or do you go— or the Black Colossus side or do you go in the, um, the Menagerie side?

	ART (As Jake): Maybe we should flank it.

	ALI (As Alexa): Oooh…
AUSTIN: That’s a good idea.  

ALI: Yeah!

AUSTIN: Okay.

ART (As Jake): So I’ll com in from the Black Colossus side and y’all come in from the Menagerie side, and I’m gonna, you make a loud noise when you open the door, and I’m gonna count 20, and then I’m gonna open the door.

ALI (As Alexa): We have the walkie-talkies, so I’m just gonna use that, like… I’ll see you then!

ART (As Jake): Alright, but remember, you’re gonna give me the signal, and then I’m gonna count 20.

	ALI (As Alexa): Mhmm!

	ART (As Jake): So you need to get, you need to sig— twenty counts before…

ALI (As Alexa): Before we leave, before we go through the door, are you gonna come late, like dramatically to save us?

ART (As Jake): No, I’m not coming late, it’s only 20, it’s only a 20 count.  It’s not… it’s, it’s just so we have the element of surprise.
	
ALI (As Alexa): Well, a 3 count seems so long in all the matches that you do, 20 seems like...

AUSTIN: [laughs]

	ART (As Jake): No I’m not, I’m not, it’s not a gimmick count.

ALI: [laughs]

	ART (As Jake): Just gonna count to 20.  

	ALI (As Alexa): Waitwaitwait, so like, one, two, three, not one of those, like a…

	ART (As Jake): No just like, [slightly faster] one, two, three, four…

	ALI (As Alexa): Okay, okay, okay…

ALI: And she’s like, moving her fingers to try to like, catch the beat I guess, and is like

	ALI (As Alexa): Okay, 20, okay, yes.

AUSTIN: Is it like one of the, this is Orville,

AUSTIN (As Orville): Is it like a count-out count?  Is it like a… and then you get to like, 15 and you start slowing down for all the, like for the drama?

	ART (As Jake): No.  ALI: [laughs]

	AUSTIN (As Orville): No? Y’know, 15! … six-sixteen!

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Pretty sure we’re doing normal human counting here.  

	ART (As Jake): Yeah, I’m not—

	AUSTIN (As Orville): Seventeen!

	ART (As Jake): I’m not kayfabin’ the, the ghost.

ALI (As Alexa): But that would be, well y’know, I don’t know if they’ve seen a wrestling match, maybe they would really like that.

	ART (As Jake): [sighs] Who I got to work with here?ALI: [laughs]

	ALI (As Alexa): Good point…

	SYLVIA (As Sid): I mean, I’d volunteer, but I’m injured,

SYLVIA: And then Sid like, taps their leg a little… rough.

	ALI (As Alexa): Oh, but that’s perfect, you can work the injury.

	SYLVIA (As Sid): No.

AUSTIN and ALI: [laugh loudly]

AUSTIN: No-selling things already!
ALI: [laughs]

SYLVIA: I’m a professional. 

	ART (As Jake): I’m not, we’re not… what would that even accomplish?

	ALI (As Alexa): Well, uh, y’know, to make the monster seem like, off-guard, ‘cause we’re like, we humans are— we’re gonna go, can you, okay…

ALI: Um, what’s this guy’s name,

	ALI (As Alexa): Orville?

	AUSTIN (As Orville): That’s me!

ALI (As Alexa): Please make sure to lock up tonight, you’re definitely gonna see us again, but, can you take care of the coffee machine for me please?

	AUSTIN (As Orville): Hooo, that’s a… Alexa that’s a big ask, but I’ll do… my best.

	ALI (As Alexa): Thank you. 

AUSTIN: And he just nods, and then like looks down at the ground, and then looks over at the coffee machine, and the coffee machine like, gurgles at him a little bit, he’s like “eugh…”

ALI: [laughs]

	ART (As Jake): It’s all confidence, dealing with that coffee machine.  

AUSTIN: So who goes where?  You said, so, who goes where first, I guess, who’s first to… or who gets dropped off, I guess is my question.  I guess Jake gets dropped off?

ART: Jake gets dropped off, and the, they go park.  

AUSTIN: So, I think I mentioned this before but the interior of the Black Colossus is based on the far reaches of Alexander the Great’s empire, kind of this like, neoclassical vibe, um, lots of columns.  It’s basically like Caesar’s Palace, except with a wider cast net of what the ancient world looks like, so like, y’know, there is a floor that is based off of, y’know, uh, north Egypt, there is a floor that’s based off of northwestern India, right, like the parts of, of, the kind of far reaches of Alexander’s whole, whole empire.  And uh, in general right now, it’s very busy in this casino, a lot of the business that had previously been going to the Menagerie is now here in the Black Colossus, because even though there are other floors in the Menagerie, knowing that there is a whole closed floor is very offputting, and it also means that the other floor is cramped, and so people just naturally overflow into other casinos, so in fact, y’know, it sounded like Millenium Black’s fear was that there would be less business, but he’s actually really benefiting from this, um, and I think you even get one or two fans who run up to you and are like,

AUSTIN (As Fan): You’re Jake the Jackal! Jake! Can I get an autograph?

	ART (As Jake): I used to be.  I’m— 

	AUSTIN (As Fan): Jake, lemme get a selfie!  … Sorry, lemme get a jelfie.

AUSTIN: And like…

	AUSTIN (As Fan): That’s what I call it with, with you.  The Jelfie!

AUSTIN: And like takes out a phone…

	ART (As Jake): Why do you… why do you already have a name for that?

AUSTIN (As Fan): I’ve been lookin’ forward to it for a long time, I heard you were in town.  I thought maybe we’d run into each other.  

ART (As Jake): Fine, fine, yeah, one, 

ART: And he like, looks at his radio and is like, 

	ART (As Jake): Yeah, one, one… selfie.

	AUSTIN (As Fan): Nope, other one!

	ART (As Jake): [sighs] Jelfie…

	AUSTIN (As Fan): Snap!

AUSTIN: He said that, he said snap, and then took a photo, um, the… so you go up to the second floor, where, so I… have we all been inside of casinos before?  I guess our listeners may not have, um, they’re cacophonous, right, like, there is just this constant, overbearing sound of slot machines, and people talking, and people in bars, and people shopping, and y’know, uh, a very light, distant sound of music playing, um, and also like that music cuts away to advertisements about like, Don Rickles coming to give a standup comedy performance soon, or like, other acts that are all well past their prime, especially in Bluff City, where like, it’s not even Vegas, y’know what I mean, like you’re not even getting people who are at the very edge of their prime, you’re getting people who’re like, on the, on the circuit.  Every now and then someone really cool comes through, but that’s it.  Uh, and, it is, it is, the feeling of actually needing to be on the casino floor and pass from place to place if you leave the core walkways is just hell, ‘cause it’s just cramped and there are a million people, and everyone’s like, even if people are having a fun time, don’t always wanna be bothered, you know what I mean, like, you’re very close to other- to a lot of other people, and you also kind of are on vacation, or are trying to do something else, and so like, you’re not tryna get bothered, but you’re so near other people, it’s just, ugh.  I don’t have a lot of fondness for casinos, but also I set a game in fake Atlantic City, so I must have some distant fondness for casinos.  Um, so you’re like, walking through this completely packed place, especially at this time of night, right, where like, it’s actually getting into the late-night crowd, all the security guards were changed recently, there’s like a whole new audience is coming out of the bars and out of the shows, the evening shows they’ve, y’know, someone just saw some cover ba- like Beatles cover band that just finished and now those people who were in that show have now come back out onto the floor, and you finally make your way up to the second floor, or the third floor, where there is the connecting bridge, the sky bridge, the sky water bridge, which is blocked by like, velvet ropes, and there’s a single guard there, who just like is, is, like, standing there, but is kind of like not doing much otherwise.  Um, and when he sees you, he actually like, opens up one of, he like pulls the, unhooks the velvet rope that’s protecting the door, and then puts a hand to his ear and just says like, 

	AUSTIN (As Guard): [low and quiet] The Jackal’s arrived.  

AUSTIN: Um, what’re you doing on this, you just gonna wait now, is this just like, and Jake waits.  

ART: Yeah, I think so, I mean that’s weird, that’s a weird thing.

AUSTIN: Ah, this is the casino that, y’know, your boss runs, so, um…

ART: I guess, yeah.

AUSTIN: Alright, other crew, this casino is dead.  Uh, it’s spooky dead.  Like, you go down to the main floor, the first floor of the casino, and no one is, there’s like, a couple dozen people, and like, this is a room that’s supposed to hold hundreds of people, maybe more, um, Luis is there, and is just kind of like… behind the desk, but isn’t, doesn’t even respond to you when he sees you, is just kind of looking off into the middle distance.  

ALI: In like a creepy way or like a sad way?

AUSTIN: Uuuh, it’s kinda creepy.  Um, and also as you walk through, you hear— it takes you a second to realize it, but like, it’s not quiet here, the bells are all still going off, all of the slot machines are still winning, down here too, but there’s no one at them, and so it’s just like, tokens pouring out of slot machines, it’s like, the little notification thing on the little like, slide card, saying like, y’know, making a little jingle that’s like “doo doo doo DOOT doo doo! You’ve won!”, “doo doo doo DOOT doo doo! You’ve won!”, like over and over again, from all of these machines around you.  And again, a handful of people are still like, braving that to be here, because that’s how Bluff City works.  Um, all of the card tables are empty, like no one is here, and upstairs, like up the escalator, you hear like a strange, um, like, I guess it’s a little bit like wind or something.  What do you do?  Also both of you roll one stress, this is a creepy experience.  SYLVIA: Ayyy…

AUSTIN: Sylvi gets a six!

ALI: Whoof!

AUSTIN: Ali gets a one…

ALI: Whoo whee… 

[crosstalk]AUSTIN: Um, Sylvi, you get a cool point.

SYLVIA: Do I get a cool?

ART: Someone gets a cool, yeah.

[crosstalk over]

AUSTIN: Ali, you lose your cool dice if you have any, and you lose a number of skill dice equal to the number of stress dice rolled, so you lose another skill die.  

ALI: Okay.

AUSTIN: Just one.

ART: Oh my…

ALI: “Complete meltdown” is not as bad as this! [laughs]

AUSTIN: Well, imagine you had gotten that on a three skill roll- on a three stress roll, right?

ALI: Yeah, yeahyeahyeah.  Hoo wee!

AUSTIN: So, take one more away.  Alexa’s had a rough one, y’all.

ALI: Chyeah… 

AUSTIN: I see you lowered your contact.  Cool.

ALI: Yeah, everything else is one.

AUSTIN: Y-yeah.  Uh, okay.  Um, what do you do?

SYLVIA: [sighs] Oh boy…

AUSTIN: Um, and behind the wind I think you can hear like, just bits of that song, that siren song.  You cannot hear that though, Jake.  

ART: Hmm.

ALI: Hmm!

SYLVIA: Hmm… Should we follow it?

ALI: Yeah, for sure, I think like, I was giving you room to speak there, but I think that like, at that stress roll especially, she doesn’t even like, look at Sid, or like, at Luis, and just like walks straight towards that escalator.  SYLVIA: Oh I like that, ‘cause then like Sid’s following just to make sure she doesn’t like, get in trouble.  

AUSTIN: Yeah… You go up the, the escalator’s turned off, so you have to walk up it, um, 

ALI: [gasps] [quietly] That’s scary…

SYLVIA: [laughs]

AUSTIN: Um, you get halfway up, and it turns on, um…

ALI: [gasps]

AUSTIN: And then like from the little, the other escalator turns on too, and it like, it is starting and stopping in a way that almost feels like it’s Morse code, or like it’s trying to— it’s like, you know those videos where like, hard drives make noise to talk?  Do you know what I’m tal— or not to talk, to play music?  People like, get eighteen hard drives together, and then they play like a Disney song, you know what I’m talking about?

SYLVIA: Oh, yeah, you know what I mean.  

AUSTIN: Have y’all not seen that?

ALI: No… [laughing]

SYLVIA: I have, yeah yeah.  They basically use, like, the computer noises for instrumentation, right, like…

AUSTIN: Yeah… I feel like it’s… it’s really cool, I’m surprised y’all haven’t seen this, people should look this up, it’s really cool, um… I feel like I should’ve been able to find one of these way quicker than this but I can’t remember any major Disney songs.  

ALI: I just googled singing hard drives, and I’m gonna see…

AUSTIN: Singing is the wrong word, that was me saying singing and that’s not right, (ALI: Oh.) what I should’ve said was hard drive, just like music.  

SYLVIA: Oh I found one for Beat It.

ALI: I’m listening to one do Beat It, yeah, this Beat It one’s really good.

SYLVIA: Yeah, this one’s, this one rules.  ALI: Oh my god…

AUSTIN: Yeah, it’s pretty intense, right?  For people who don’t know what the fuck we’re listening to, it’s just like 16 hard drives making different types of beep, not beeps, mechanical sounds, like parts of them are moving or spinning at different speeds, or like searching in a way that produces different like, buzzes and chirps, and it combines to like, be a really well layered version of a song.

SYLVIA: Mhmm, yeah, if you wanna check it out, just search for like, um, floppy drive orchestra.  

AUSTIN: Yes, that’s what it is.

ALI: So is it like the escalator making those sounds, or is it just…

AUSTIN: So it is, and then like, well the thing is like that’s what it is that first you’re like “what is happening?”, and then you notice that is doing it and then the, like, other machines are also now doing it, like as you go into the second floor, you can hear that the, the bells and whistles of the slot machines aren’t just winning any more, they’re collaborating with all of the other machine sounds to make this song.  ALI: I’m, I’m gonna just say, full stop, I’m terrified of escalators, so that’s really scary, um… [laughs]

AUSTIN: Uh huh.  They’re scary!

ALI: They’re really scary.  Whoof, okay, that’s really weird, I think that that like, does not help the like, weird compulsion that’s happening here, for sure.  

AUSTIN: No, it shouldn’t, it probably shouldn’t help it.  

ALI: Um, yeah, no, um, so I think that she like, moves up a little faster.

AUSTIN: Okay.  And she gets up there and… I think she sees it first, which is like, you pass a threshold, and suddenly you’re not in the Menagerie, a casino that’s based on wildlife, you are at, uh, y’know, a Scottish loch, you are at, y’know, somewhere in the north-west European Atlantic, um, surrounded by a forest, and instead of the machines making all of that noise, it feels like nature is making that noise.  The birds are chirping in time with each other, and there are deer running through the woods, or whatever animals are in Europe, they have deer, right?  Um, and you can hear them foot on ground and twigs breaking, to collaborate as the percussion to this song that is being sung near the where the skybridge is, and funny thing, where the skybridge is is still a door, just standing out in, just at this beach basically.  

01:30:00

ART: I had a weird moment ‘cause I thought the s- I was like “yeah, the all the, they’re making that song”, and then it was Beat It in my head again.  

AUSTIN: [laughs] I mean maybe it is, I don’t know, y’know?  I’m sure someone’s done like an, a operatic cover of Beat It.  

ALI: Um, yeah, I think I’m still doing my thing, like if you hadn’t described that door, I would have her like, straight up just be walking into that water, um, [laughing] so if anyone else wants a, like a... 

AUSTIN: I mean so, so Sid, you see, I think you just straight up see Alexa disappear when she hits the top of the, the top of the escalator, 

SYLVIA: [crosstalk] Oh my fuck… 

AUSTIN: ...if you have like a foot in front of you, she just like fades away, and then you are fading away, too quickly to even react to it, and then you’re both up top.  

SYLVIA: [laughs]

ALI: The uh, camera shot on that must be amazing, ‘cause it’s like Sid like, five elevator steps behind her.

AUSTIN: Uh huh, it’s right there, totally.

ALI: [sighing] Yeah, god… 

AUSTIN: Um, so Sid, what do you do when you pop up?  Also there’s no escalator back, obviously.  

SYLVIA: I mean the, the first thing I do I think is try the walkie talkie to contact Jake.

AUSTIN: It works.  

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Hey— 

AUSTIN: Actually, maybe that’s a technology roll, that’s a technology roll to see if y’all can have contact, totally.  

SYLVIA: Alright, uh, 3d6, it’s a 6!

AUSTIN: Six!

ALI: Nice…

AUSTIN: Probably not two franchise dice from this, but maybe one, for like, you are in contact with each other.

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Hey, J-Jake?

ART: Well, it’s a fact that directly leads to us solving the case because it’s, it’s a real, it’s not…

AUSTIN: Right, right sure.  

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Hey Jake, so um, little situation here...

AUSTIN: Eh, I’ll give you two, fuck it.  

SYLVIA (As Sid): So we went up the escalator… and, um… wh- [sighs], kinda in a forest now.  Um… ver- d-... Alexa’s actin’ weird and, uh, I’ll be honest, it’s a little bit stressful.  Um, help?  [quietly] Please?

ART (As Jake): You want me to… oh… alright, it ain’t the plan.  But you’re right, Alexa’s been acting weird tonight.

SYLVIA (As Sid): It got weirder, and, um, also I think the plan may have… been a little, may have been flipped on its head by the… t-teleporting?  I think this is what that is?

ART (As Jake): Nah, you obviously didn’t teleport, ‘cause I can hear you on the walkie, these things only have a range of, y’know, a couple hundred yards.

SYLVIA (As Sid): Tru- Okay.  Good point.  This casino is a forest now, is I think the thing we need to be focusing on.

	ART (As Jake): Alright, I’ll be right there, just don’t… don’t get ahead of yourself.  

	SYLVIA (As Sid): I don’t even… I don’t even know how I could… at this point…

AUSTIN: [laughs]

	ART (As Jake): Over and out.  

	SYLVIA (As Sid): … r-roger.

	ART (As Jake): No, you don’t say anything after “over and out”.  

	SYLVIA: …over and out.  

	ART (As Jake): ...MMmm…

[everyone laughs]

SYLVIA: And then Sid hits the button that makes the other one do like, a ringtone.

AUSTIN: [laughs]

ART: Like, you can see the moment where he thinks about taking the batteries out of the walkie, but does like that’s, like shakes his head no and… and opens the door.

AUSTIN: When your hand touches the door, you hear someone behind you say,

	AUSTIN (As Someone): Hold it!  Stop!

AUSTIN: and it is Jacob Vander, his nose all bloodied still, like, uh, has got it like all… probably has on like um, like a hard plastic face guard at this point.  

ART: Sure, like a Chauncey Billips?

AUSTIN: Yeah, exactly.  

	AUSTIN (As Jacob): This is our case, Jake!

ART (As Jake): This ain’t your case.  My people are already in there.  You need… to let us handle this.
	
	AUSTIN (As Jacob): My people are already in there!

	ART (As Jake): What?

AUSTIN (As Jacob): We went in, uh, an hour ago.  I been waitin’ for the signal to go in.  From this side.  

ART (As Jake): Well, I just got the signal to go in on my side, and my people have been there twenty minutes.  Sorry to tell you this, but your people are probably dead.  

ALI: Wh- yo!

SYLVIA: What the fuck.

AUSTIN (As Jacob): You shut your mouth, my people, my people are the best in the business.  

ART (As Jake): Then where’s your signal?

AUSTIN (As Jacob): I don’t know, it— 

ART (As Jake): And why isn’t Sid tellin’ me it’s crawling with jerks over here?

AUSTIN (As Jacob): ‘Cause we don’t crawl, we walk on two legs!

AUSTIN: And he like chest bumps out.  

	AUSTIN (As Jacob): Also we’re not creeps!  Is another one, is another reason.  

	ART (As Jake): There you go.  Look kid…

	AUSTIN (As Jacob): I’m not your kid, dad, I um, hmm…

[ALI and SYLVIA laugh]

	AUSTIN (As Jacob): Man!

	ART (As Jake): Aw, you’re welcome, fan fiction writers.  

AUSTIN: [laughs] I guess we haven’t canonically said whether or not they’re father and son, I don’t, I don’t know.  

ART: You’re saying Jake named his own kid Jacob?

AUSTIN: [laughs] I wouldn’t, I wouldn’t put it past him.  We don’t even Jake is his real name, maybe Jake is his, his stage name.  

ART: Oh, like Dusty Rhodes named his kid Dustin?

AUSTIN: Literally like that, yes.  

ART: Mmm…

	ART (As Jake): Look, I get it.  The Trenton outfit.

	AUSTIN (As Jacob): Thank you.

ART (As Jake): You’re tryin’.  I get it.  And it’s hard, you got a lotta shiny stuff, and you ain’t got no wits between the lot of ya.  I just got a call, they need my help, I’m goin’ through that door, you feel free to try and stop me.  

	AUSTIN (As Jacob): Lemme go in with you.

	ART (As Jake): Yeh, fine.  

AUSTIN: The, the security like, who put his hand to his ear before looks at you and is like,

	AUSTIN (As Guard): You uh, you sure about this boss?

	ART (As Jake): Yeah, I’m sure.  

	AUSTIN (As Guard): You’re sure— 

	ART (As Jake): But.  

	AUSTIN (As Guard): But.  

AUSTIN: He’s like, pau- He’s pausing a lot, he’s pausing, he’s tryna gather his thoughts.  

	ART (As Jake): Put someone on their van.  

AUSTIN (As Guard): Put someone on their van.  Oh he said, okay, yeah, well, can y- can you put someone on their van?  I think he’s asking me to ask you to put someone on their- yeah, that’s right.  O- Yeah, he said okay.  

ART (As Jake): That van doesn’t leave here without me talking to someone.  AUSTIN (As Guard): He says that- you can hear him?  Oh, yeah, okay, yeah.  Yep, he said yes.  

ART (As Jake): Great.  You still in?

AUSTIN (As Jacob): Damn right.  

ART (As Jake): Alright, take it down.  

AUSTIN (As Jacob): … Darn right.  

ART (As Jake): That’s not what I meant.  

ART: [laughing] And he opens the door.  

AUSTIN: Um, it is the inside of a skydridge, uh, going into another casino, and you can see Sid and you can see Alexa, just like, across the skybridge, out in the casino floor.  

ART: But I don’t see… John Paul Saint James or… does that really say Mint Mocha?

AUSTIN: Mint Mocha, yeah.

ART: I forgot that one.  

AUSTIN: Yeah, she’s good.  Uh, yeah, I, I don’t think you do, no.

ART: Okay.  Alright so, y’know, Jake’s lookin’ around, but he’s walkin’, he’s got his hand on his ghost mace trigger.  

AUSTIN: A big shark swims above you, ‘cause you’re inside of this big aquarium skybridge, remember?

ART: Yeah.  Jake makes eye contact with the shark and nods.

AUSTIN: The shark, like, swims away, and then swims back and nods, and then keeps swimmin’.  

ART: Aw, I love this, why do we do anything but Bluff City?

[AUSTIN and ALI laugh]

AUSTIN: Um, and you get to the other side, and, I mean one is, you could see through, the door was already open on this side, on their side, right?

ART: Oh, sure.  

AUSTIN: Um, and the second you pass through the threshold, you are… on this beach with them.  

ART: So they didn’t see me before, 

AUSTIN: No.

ART: They didn’t have any acknowledgement.

AUSTIN: No, how close like, so Alexa and Sid, how close were you, like what were you doing during all of this?  Just kind of exploring this area?

SYLVIA: I mean like I said, I think Sid was mostly just following behind Alexa to make sure she didn’t get hurt.

AUSTIN: Yeah… Sid, are you recording all of this also?

SYLVIA: Oh def, oh yeah yeah, cmon, professional here.  

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: Makin’ sure.  

ALI: Um, yeah, is it still like, creepy song and stuff?

AUSTIN: Yeahyeahyeahyeah.  

ALI: Um, does Jake come through the door that was across from me, or…?AUSTIN: Jake like, in a very cheesy TV effect, just appears, like phases in in front of the door.

ART: Ha!

ALI: Okaaay [laughs]

AUSTIN: And then Jacob does too.  ALI: Okay, um…

AUSTIN: And Jacob had just, at some point pulled out a gun, by the way.  SYLVIA: [quietly] Fuck…

ART: What!? Like a, like a human gun?

AUSTIN: Like a, just a glock, yeah, just like a pistol. 

	ART (As Jake): [crosstalk] The hell are you doin’ with that?

AUSTIN: And he has it down, in like a secret agent pose, y’know.  	AUSTIN (As Jacob): [crosstalk ends] They have my people!  I can’t let em’ hurt them.  

	ART (As Jake): You ever shot a ghost?

AUSTIN (As Jacob): Eugh… I feel like someone’s asked me that before.  Wait, there’s not a ghost, this isn’t a ghost, I just remembered.  Hey, Trenton Terranormal investigation, not everything’s a ghost.

ART (As Jake): Thought that was our slogan.

ART: I actually don’t remember that, that’s me, I don’t know.  

AUSTIN: Okay, 

AUSTIN (As Jacob): I thought it was ours, I get confused.  

ALI: Um, yikes, so… I think that she’s still walking forward, but she reaches into a, um, like an inside pocket in her blazer, and pulls out aquamarine, which isn’t just a joke about this episode, but also is for bravery, communication skills and confidence, which she knows, of course.

AUSTIN: Of course! ALI: [laughs] and I think she reaches her [continues laughing] um, her other hand into her pocket on the opposite side and pulls out her cellphone, and then like walks into the ocean deep enough that it’s kind of coming up to her ankles.

AUSTIN: Mmm…

ALI: Um, and, maybe like activates the app, it’s like one of those apps where you talk into it and it’ll translate it for you too, um, and I think that sheee, what does she say, what does she say… um, 

ART: Hey hey hey it’s me, I tore up your skin!

[ALI and AUSTIN laugh]

[SYLVIA sighs]

ALI: Fwoof, um, I think that she says… 

ALI (As Alexa): You can stay here, if you want.  

ALI: And is that a tech roll, or a… 

AUSTIN: Oh, is that it, that’s the, okay, I wasn’t sure.

ALI: [laughs] what else am I gonna… I’m tryna initiate a conversation, not like, uh… 

AUSTIN: Um, I don’t know, is it a, I’m a little torn on whether it’s a tech roll or a contact roll, or a, it’s a tech roll, you’re using this gear to see, right?

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: ‘Cause we’ve established this thing is, is busted.  

ALI: Fair, fair.  Fwoof, can I take one from the bank?

AUSTIN: [crosstalk] Are you gonna spend any, bank, yeah, you can.

ALI: Do we have any… what is that, our credit card?  AUSTIN: That is bank, it just says bank.  Oh, you know what, you could actually do credit card, you could do credit card, which is technology, yes.  

ALI: Okay, we’ll save the bank for…

AUSTIN: For emergencies, yeah.  ALI: Yes, yes yes.  

AUSTIN: Uh, so that could be a 2d6, ope, I closed Roll20.  Good.

ALI: Um, [laughs]

ART: It was a five.  

AUSTIN: Alright, so, I think that means you do make contact, right?  

ALI: Yeah.

AUSTIN: It’s a five, so what happens?

ALI: Pfff, feel like I’ve been heavy on describing the facts here, so anyone who wants to chime in, by all means.  Um...

ART: Well you get something that leads to solving the case, like what are we tryna…’

ALI: Um… I think we’re tryna like, find out… why this thing is here, and also buh… like I feel like the thing that I am setting up is like, having it live, like, normally, not like normally, but like not in a way that’s like aggressive.  

AUSTIN: And also not in the ocean?  You just like, you want it to stay, right?  Or am I misunderstanding?  ALI: Yeah I— 

ART: She, she tore up the skin, it’s not going back in the ocean.

AUSTIN: Yeah.

ALI: [laughs]... um, yeah, I dunno, I feel like the ocean’s like [laughs] it’s like a prison, or like, I dunno, I felt like that coat was a prison.  ART: The ocean is like a prison.  

AUSTIN: [dramatically] The ocean… is like a prison.  ART: To a sea creature, she says this.  ALI: [laughs] shhhh…

AUSTIN: Well like maybe this is where we get— 

ART: Two thirds of the land mass of the…AUSTIN: But maybe this is where we get the thing, right, like, maybe it was a prison.  Maybe she was imprisoned there, by some other town forever ago.  

ALI: Yeah, maybe it was like, okay, so maybe that’ll be my fact, is that like that’s what the selkie is, is that it was like a lady in this town…

AUSTIN: Not this town, but like this, whatever this distant…

ALI: The like, yeah, the like, five hundred years ago across the sea, like…

ART: Cursed to live as a seal until she could gamble her way out of it?

AUSTIN: Well no, not that second part, maybe.  

ALI: Well they didn’t know about casinos, but they were like “she’s like a witch or whatever, she’s a bad egg, we gotta get rid of her”, so they like, wrapped her in like a big, like a silk robe or whatever, and like, threw her into the sea.  She became [laughs] she became like a sea monster and finally found like, she finally like, made it to the other side, and was able to escape.  AUSTIN: And this comes to you via, via what?

ALI: [laughs] Um...

AUSTIN: Is this like, you can start understanding the song?

ALI: Yes.  Yeah, it’s like a, um, it’s like a, so I think that like, oh god, so, before, um— 

AUSTIN: So I can stop googling the lyrics to various songs about luck?  Classic songs about luck like Lucky Star by Madonna, and Lucky Man by Emerson, Lake And Palmer, ‘cause I’ve been looking for lyrics that might be appropriate, but now that I’ve heard what the lyrics need to be, which is “I was a witch and they threw me in the sea and I became a sea creature”, I don’t think I’m gonna find that classic 80s jam.  

ALI: Um, pffgod, yeah, I think that like, before, when they were researching, they went to like, a website or whatever with different folk songs, and there was a song that they heard that was like “oh, there was this big monster, and we conquered it, and now the town is safe, and yadda yadda yadda”.

AUSTIN: Ah, and now— 

ART: And with the rollicking chorus of “throw the witch in the ocean!”

AUSTIN: Well no, ‘cause that wasn’t there on the version you found on the website, you, you’re hearing the missing verse that says “I was a witch and they threw me in the ocean” [laughs].

ALI: Yeah, no, it’s like the same exact, like, um, melody and everything, but it’s from her perspective, which is just like “I was innocent and then they killed me”.  

AUSTIN: Right, it’s like what if 4:44 came our first, and then Lemonade dropped.  
ALI: Pfff! [laughs] Exactly like that.  

ART: Is that what that album’s about?  I haven’t listened to it.

AUSTIN: Oh buddy…

ALI: Fwoof…

AUSTIN: Yeah… Jay-z cheated on his wife, man.  ART: Did… did he get some good songs about it.

AUSTIN: Aeeh…

ALI: I hear it’s good.

AUSTIN: It’s okay.

ART: He’s had a bad run.  

AUSTIN: Yeah.  He’s gettin’ old.  

ALI: Yeah, it’s tough to get old...

AUSTIN: Anyway, I really think that the Jay-z and Kanye from the Otis video would have a lot of fun in Bluff City.  Anyway...

ALI: Aww, we should make those as characters, jot that down. AUSTIN: Uh huh.  I’ll just add it.  

ALI: Aziz should be there too.  

AUSTIN: Yeah, when does Bluff City take place?  Whenever Jay-z and Kanye were still friends.  

ALI: [laughs] aww…

ART: Are they all the way not friends, is that in that album too?

ALI: I think there was a thing in that album but I haven’t heard it yet, and…

AUSTIN: There was a thing in the world where they’re just not there any more, so...

ALI: Yeah, I think that there’s been like, there’s been some stuff.  I think Jay-z mentions it directly on that album but I don’t… remember…

AUSTIN: He disses Kim I think also— anyway.  So you hear this song, and so what you say is?  “You don’t have to go,” is that what you said?

ALI: Or like “you can stay here… that you don’t have to go back”.  

AUSTIN: and I think her, um… and I think her song changes, and, also, wait, the song is still in this other language, which means you don’t get “I was a witch and they threw me in the sea”, what you get was like “I was an evil magic woman”, because your translator’s fucked, “and [laughs] they wrapped me in a water dog’s flayed flesh, and dipped me in the large pond”.

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: Art in the chat says “and then she’s like ‘I invented swag’”.  

ALI: [continues laughing]

AUSTIN: Truth.  Um, so yeah, you get this through badly translated English through your broken machine, um, slowly get her song, and then I think she opens the door.  Um, what’s she look like?  I think… she’s in her human form, right?  She’s not like a seal at all.  

ALI: Um, hmm…

AUSTIN: I mean maybe she’s just Beyonce.  

ALI: [laughs]

SYLVIA: Oh my god…

ALI: I was gonna say that she shouldn’t just be like, just a human, or like, just a gal, but like, Beyonce is clearly… 

AUSTIN: What if Beyonce was Poison Ivy?

ALI: Oooh!

SYLVIA: Yeeeah!

ART: And if I had magic powers, I’d look more like Beyonce, I’ll tell you that.  

AUSTIN: Yeah, true facts.

ALI: Yeah, for sure, yeah, like… Beyonce for sure is already above human, like, excellence, um, so that’s fine, but it was like, oh god, what if it was like Beyonce… who is Poison Ivy, but it was all like, seaweed, yes, Sylvi just said in chat, yes, [laughs]

SYLVIA: Yeah, [hurried noises], okay, yeah.  

AUSTIN: With seaweed and stuff, yesyesyesyesyes.  One hundred percent yes.  

ART: Are we M. Night Shamylan’s Lady In The Water now?
ALI: Shhh...
SYLVIA: No, we’re good is what we are, so…

AUSTIN: Beyonce wasn’t in that.  
ALI: Yeah, Beyonce also wasn’t in that.  And you don’t just have the one big arm, I love that movie… 

AUSTIN: I was gonna make that same joke! I was gonna make that joke, I was gonna make that joke.  

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: Aw, god, okay.  Um, and she just, what’s she do?  Uh, I think Jake pulls up a gun on her, is what happens, or not Jake, Jacob, Jacob’s like, 

	AUSTIN (As Jacob): Where are my friends?

AUSTIN: And then she says something, and then the computer translates it to be like, to just say like “men”.

	ART (As Jake): Put it down.

	AUSTIN (As Jacob): C-come ooon.  Where’d my friends go?

	ART (As Jake): We’ll figure it out, put it down.  

ART: Oh we, we’re up to 14 on our franchise score.  

AUSTIN: You are.  Yeah, or what was the second fact?  Oh I guess the second fact was…

ART: It was one fact, is what I thought.  

AUSTIN: Here she is…

ALI: Yeah, I only have one.  

AUSTIN: Yeah, okay.  Oh right, ‘cause the other one came from the walkie talkie working before, yes.  Cool.  Um, give me a sway, or a contact rather, to, to talk him down.  

ART: Aw, I shouldn’ta tried to talk, shoulda just maced him.  

AUSTIN: [laughs] So it goes.  [quietly] Oh man...

ALI: You got good contacts, you could make this, also we have all this bank.  

AUSTIN: You should spend a bank money maybe.  ART: Well then how do I spend, what, I’m gonna put it down, here’s ten bucks, what’re we doin’ here?

AUSTIN: I mean it’s not actually that, it’s, you’ve invested in… like, this can represent something that you’ve already spent, do you know what I mean, like, that was you buying the book of like, how to make friends and, or how to win at friends and influence people or whatever, right, or it’s you standing in front of a really nice mirror you bought, practicing your promos.  

ART: Alright, I’ll roll 3d6 and then I’ll roll the bank die separately, right?

AUSTIN: Okay, uh huh… There’s a five, now roll the bank die.  Uh, withdrawal, no penalty, lose the dice, okay cool, um, so you go down to one bank, uh, and you got a five, so what, um, what do you tell him?

ART (As Jake): If she knows where they are, she’s not gonna tell you if she’s shot, put it down, we’ll, we’ll work this out.  

AUSTIN: Um, she nods, and then Jacob [sighs as Jacob], and then lowers it, doesn’t put it away.  And he says,

	AUSTIN (As Jacob): I’ll lower it, but I’m not putting it away.

	ART (As Jake): Alright, you lift that thing up again, I’m gonna mace you.

	AUSTIN (As Jacob): Is that like a wrestling move?

	ART (As Jake): Heh, you’ll find out.  

	AUSTIN (As Jacob): Eeeh…

ART: It’s weird he asked, I’m holding a giant can of mace.  

AUSTIN: [laughs]... and with the song still playing from nature in the background, she then like, walks back to the door and like, like motions for you to follow her in.ALI: I go, I don’t know about the rest of y’all.

ART: Yeah…

SYLVIA: Oh yeah, no totally.  

ART: I’m in it the whole way.  

AUSTIN: Okay… um, and, when you walk through that door you’re back in, like you’re all in the door and you close the door and you’re back in the skybridge, but this time you’re in the skybridge on, it’s, you close the door and you’re at the wrong side of the skybridge, you’re like back at the, the Black Colossus side, and she’s just walking back towards the Menagerie again, with the door closed on the other side.  

SYLVIA: This gonna make me dizzy…

AUSTIN: Uh, gimme a stress roll from everybody.  

ALI: Just one?

AUSTIN: Just one stress, yeah.  Um, Sid, you don’t need to, or you can, you can roll it, ‘cause maybe you’ll get more cool… but…

SYLVIA: Eh.  

ALI: [whispered] That’s a six [inaudible]

AUSTIN: Oh, Ali gets a six.

ALI: Finally!

AUSTIN: To get a point of cool, and suffer no stress.  

ART: Uh, five, so it’s shake it off, no cool.  

AUSTIN: No cool?  And then Sid, you should roll, just to see what it is.

ART: Blasé is about right too I think, for the… 

ALI: [laughs]

SYLVIA: I got a three, so…

AUSTIN: So you can ignore it, it’s just like…

SYLVIA: Okay, yeah, alright.

AUSTIN: Yeahyeahyeah, alright, uh, so the way that works is that cool, if, for every point of cool that you have you can ignore the worst stress roll, 

ART: The lowest, yeah.

AUSTIN: Yeah, so, you can ignore that three.  Uh, awesome, so you, she walks you across the, the skybridge, and this time, I mean it maybe just takes you a second, um, but their aquarium is empty.  In fact, there’s not even any, there’s only like half of the water is in it, and when you look around, you see that like, the, it’s even like still kind of under construction, um, and when you look outside, like through the water, um, you can see that Bluff City is like a little older than it was, than it is now.  It’s like, the cars are from the late seventies.

ART: My friend the shark…

AUSTIN: Not there.  Or there’s a little baby shark, gives you a nod.

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: No, I don’t think there’s any fish in yet, um, and she opens the other door, and it’s the Menagerie again.  But there’s no slot machines there, there’s no card tables, the carpet isn’t rolled out anywhere yet.  Um, and you can hear, um, the sound of people calling out to each other from far on the other side of this huge casino floor, and just, you hear people like, you hear stuff banging, you hear stuff like, work is being done, it sounds like physical work is being done.  Also the escalator down is off and is, like, in fact, the escalator down is not even visible, there’s a new wall, or like a temporary wall blocking off where the escalator would be at this point 

	ART (As Jake): Why are we here?

AUSTIN: Umm… and then she says like… and I’m gonna not do bad translation jokes, she just says like, 

	AUSTIN (As Selkie): My song heard their song.

AUSTIN: Um, and then continues to walk down this like, unbuilt casino floor, or like half-built casino floor, half furnished I guess, really.

ART: Are there people here, are they lookin’ at us, like are we— 

AUSTIN: They’re off in the distance, and like, soon you’re able to get closer and closer, um, and you can see the other members of Trenton Terranormal like, paralyzed in fear, and then you can see… couple dozen people, uh, in coveralls, with like name tags on them, that say just like “Jim” and y’know, “Mellissa” or whatever, installing slot machines, and like, laying out the carpet and affixing the chandeliers, and they also… are all skeleton people.

SYLVIA: Woooah...

ART: What?

AUSTIN: Give me a two stress roll.

ART: You really slow-rolled us on the skeleton people.  

AUSTIN: Well you had to get close, you were getting closer and closer.  So, you can ignore the four, and take the five, so blasé, nice work.  Or no you take the lower one, sorry, you take the lower one, so, uh, take a one stress die Sylvi to your next roll, um…

SYLVIA: Well, don’t I ignore the lowest stress die for each cool die that I have?

ART: [crosstalk] No, ‘cause… yeah.  

AUSTIN: Oh it is the lowest, you’re right, you’re right, you’re right, you’re blasé.

SYLVIA: Yeah, it wouldn’t make sense to ignore the highest one.  

AUSTIN: Yeah, of course.  Um, you’re blasé, Art, you are stressed so lose one, and then Ali, you are blasé also.  You’ve kinda found your… your footing.  

ALI: Yeah I… should be frazzled but I had the cool die, I guess?

AUSTIN: Yeah, exactly, the cool die prevents that, yeah, exactly, so you’re just blasé also.  Yep.  Um, but there are just skeleton people who are just going about their days, like, installing all this stuff.

ART: They built this casino with skeleton people?

AUSTIN: [sigh] The selkie sighs.

	AUSTIN (As Selkie): They built it with real people, and then… the real people never left.

AUSTIN: Um, and… one of the Terranormal people, I think, uh, John Paul Saint James, nice boss guy that there, he’s like,

AUSTIN (As John): We’ve seen them do it three times.  It’s happened three times.  It’s gonna happen again soon.

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Wait, like done thi- made the casino three times, or…

AUSTIN: And then the floor gives out.  

SYLVIA: Oh christ.  

AUSTIN: And they fall.  And it’s like, the louder sound is not the sound of them falling, it’s like, as they fall, the song gets cut off, and then the cacophony of the casino like, lifts back up, and then from behind you, the skeleton crew comes back, and they begin to repair the floor where people fell in.  And they ignore you, they’re not looking at you, they’re not doing anything with you.  SYLVIA: [sigh] Okay…

	ALI (As Alexa): I- Is there any way to stop it?

	SYLVIA (As Sid): I… I don’t think it’s like, actually… hap- like, 

AUSTIN (As Selkie): It already happened.

SYLVIA (As Sid): Yeah, I think it’s showing like, something that happened when they were making the casino here.

	ALI (As Alexa): The- are they not like you?

AUSTIN: She shakes her head.  

AUSTIN (As Selkie): I thought they were.  I recognized the song of… those who were wounded, unjustly.  It sounded like my song.  But they were buried here.  I was sent into the world.  Maybe there’s a way to free them.  But I’m not sure.

AUSTIN (As Mint): Not here.

AUSTIN: Um, Mint Mocha says,

AUSTIN (As Mint): If we can get out of here, we could… ah… we could find their bodies maybe.  I don’t… I got some holy water?

ALI (As Alexa): Yeah, this is gonna be a lot of obsidian, but uh… 

AUSTIN: [laugh/snorts]

SYLVIA (As Sid): Isn’t the whole thing with like, restless spirits that we need to like, make it so they can be at rest, instead of like… banishing them with rocks?

ALI (As Alexa): Well, I don’t think, well, spiritually, stop, um, I don’t think we should move their bodies...

	SYLVIA (As Sid): D-Do you have a reason why, or...?

	ALI (As Alexa): Well, ‘cause you just said, the whole restless thing.

SYLVIA (As Sid): Yeah, like, they didn’t get, like, a prop- like their families don’t know what happened to them, they didn’t get a proper burial or anything, and like, I’m assuming the casino didn’t get any repercussions from this because it’s here.  

ALI (As Alexa): Okay, yeah, yes.  Huh…

SYLVIA (As Sid): Do you know any other names?

SYLVIA: Sid asks, turning back to the selkie.  

AUSTIN: They have tags.  

SYLVIA: With their full names on it, or just their…

AUSTIN: No.  

SYLVIA: Ah, yeah.  

02:00:00

AUSTIN (As Selkie): I expected… I expected people locked up.  Normally when I hear a call like this, it’s people locked up, and I ride to the windows and break ‘em open, and they can come out into the wild with me, but… this is different.  And this place, all these lights, all this sound, this is hell.  Someone stole my jacket.  

ART (As Jake): Huh, yeah… I hear.

SYLVIA: Sid looks DIRECTLY at Alexa.

ALI: [laughs]

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Mhmm?

	ALI (As Alexa): Did you… still want that?

AUSTIN (As Selkie): I know what happened to my jacket, but… ah, maybe it worked out in the end.  By destroying it I was able to contact you.

	ALI (As Alexa): It felt bad…

	AUSTIN (As Selkie): I wish you hadn’t…

	ART (As Jake): Yeah, we’re all agreed, that was impulsive and reckless, right?  

AUSTIN (As Selkie): Y’all didn’t research that, there wasn’t a… that was a thoughtless act?

	SYLVIA (As Sid): We didn’t really have a chance to object.

	ART (As Jake): Sometimes she just gets taken, ya know?

	ALI (As Alexa): It felt oppressive.

AUSTIN (As Selkie): It was.  I’m happy to… I can talk to people.  That’s something.  And I guess I can… live on, on the land again.  

ALI (As Alexa): There are other ways to go back to the sea.  You don’t have to go back into the… whatever that was.  

	ART (As Jake): I believe the big pond is… oh, you meant… uh… I got it, I got it.  

	AUSTIN (As Selkie): I’ve shown you what I can show you.

	ALI (As Alexa): Okay.

	ART (As Jake): Alright.

	ALI (As Alexa): We’ll make this right.

	AUSTIN (As Selkie): Promise.

	ALI (As Alexa): I pinky swear.  

ALI: And she like, puts her phone in her pocket and like, holds up her pinky.  

AUSTIN: She says

	AUSTIN (As Selkie): I don’t have a knife.  

	ALI (As Alexa): Oh n- oh… 

ALI: She like… 

	ALI (As Alexa): Um, no, uh, you do, you do like-

ALI: And she does it with herself [laugh].

ALI (As Alexa): It’s just like a, it’s like a, it’s like a thing we, we humans do, and it’s supposed to be really sweet but you made it kinda weird.  Um, we’ll just go.  

AUSTIN (As Selkie): As long as you promise.  

AUSTIN: And then she puts out a pinkie.  

ALI: [laughs] Kay, perfect.  

AUSTIN: And then squeezes your pinkie.

ALI: [gasps]

AUSTIN: Not hard, like, not, like it’s, it’s… You can’t really do much with that, but like aaah…

[ART and ALI laugh]

ALI: Could you imagine, oooh, like a pinkie hold, no, okay I get it, yes.  

AUSTIN: Yeah, um… you pull your hand off, and now you have like a pinkie ring tattoo, it’s like a little bit of seaweed around where she pinky swore with you.  

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Aw man, that, that’s sick.  

AUSTIN: It’s pretty sick.

ALI: [laughs]

	ART (As Jake): Who gets seaweed tattoos, you’re both wrong about this.  

AUSTIN: But also it’s like, it’s also like a musical bar, and there’s like, the notes of her song are on there too, [laughs] it’s very detailed for a little pinkie tattoos.

ALI: I gotta get this tattoo… I already have a pinkie tattoo, so I can’t, but, if I didn’t.

AUSTIN: You have two pinkies.

ALI: I do have two pinkies…

AUSTIN: Uh, and then she walks you back to the, to the skybridge.  

ART (As Jake): How the hell are we gonna fix this?  We don’t, we don’t even work for that casino.

	SYLVIA (As Sid): We could probably find records somewhere.  

ALI (As Alexa): Yeah, there’s records, there’s employee records, there’s missing persons files.

ART (As Jake): So you think the mobbed-up casino killed some workers, and then left a paper trail?

	SYLVIA (As Sid): I mean I did also tape the entire thing.  

	ALI (As Alexa): True, there’s also that.  

AUSTIN (As Selkie): You don’t keep records of the sagas, you don’t keep… in my day if you… did something like this, it was written up somewhere.  Sure, you might dress it up as good, but the records were kept.  You say you threw me into the river because, y’know, you didn’t like that I was swaying the town against your leadership, you at least called me a witch.  You wrote it down.  Have to be records somewhere.

	ART (As Jake): Iunno, we can look…

	ALI (As Alexa): Well, if anything we know where they are.  

	ART (As Jake): You just gonna show up with a shovel?

ALI (As Alexa): Well I, grave robbing is on the bottom of the list here, but it’s an option, and I just want everyone to know that it’s an option.  

SYLVIA (As Sid): Technically it’s… it’s not grave robbing because it’s not really a grave, um, that’s the whole crux of why they’re not resting.  

AUSTIN: [laughs]

ART (As Jake): It’s almost certainly vandalism, I don’t think you can walk into anywhere and just be like “I’m gonna start digging up your floor, ‘cause you murdered someone”.

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Vandalism charges aren’t as bad as you think.

	AUSTIN (As Jacob): They’re pretty bad though, we don’t do illegal things.  

AUSTIN: Says Jacob.

	SYLVIA (As Sid): You don’t, you are correct.  

SYLVIA: And Sid just kinda nods.

	AUSTIN (As Jacob): Finally some respect!

	SYLVIA (As Sid): Uh, nope, that wasn’t…

	AUSTIN (As John): Oh, son…

AUSTIN: Says uh, John Paul Saint James, and puts a hand on his shoulder.  It’s very unclear what the lineage is at this point.  If there’s lineage, if it’s just… 

ALI (As Alexa): Look, are you gonna help us with this, or are we gonna take care of this ourselves.  

AUSTIN (As John): Ah well… y’know, we… you have to understand… it was the Veranda family that… is paying us, you see.  

ART (As Jake): I dunno, make it worth their while, they got a whole floor of slot machines outta commission.  

	AUSTIN (As John): Ah, we’re already doing this as a, as a favor, to the family.

	ALI (As Alexa): Jake, are you here to make money or set things right?

ART (As Jake): Wait, we’re really glossing over the fact that they owe the favor to the, to the mob.  

ALI (As Alexa): Who owns this casino, right?

AUSTIN (As John): Yeah… and they’re not gonna like… this.

ART (As Jake): How’d you get into them?

AUSTIN (As John): It wasn’t me directly, we… it’s the Trenton family, y’know.  You owe a fa… it’s a lot… 

AUSTIN: And Mint Mocha is like, 

AUSTIN (As Mint Mocha): They got up to no good, and the family dug ‘em out.  Everybody has a bad time in Bluff City.  

ART (As Jake): Hmmm…

AUSTIN (As Mint Mocha): Oh honey don’t gimme that face.  

ART: [snorts] Jake like, bursts into a wide grin.  

AUSTIN: [laughs] And uh, I think at that point you’re led back to the skybridge and like, halfway through the skybridge, like when you go out the other door, you’re just back in the black colossus.

SYLVIA (As Sid): We should talk to, um, 

SYLVIA: We don’t have his name written down and I’m completely blanking on it, the guy who hired us.  

AUSTIN: Oh, Millennium Black.

ART: Mad money?  

SYLVIA (As Sid): We should talk to Millennium Black about it.  

AUSTIN: He’s actually, funny story, he’s just there on the other side, of the, like when you open the door, he’s already there, um… in like a long black overcoat, um, and like a black suit and a golden tie.  

	ART (As Jake): That’s a nice coat.  

	AUSTIN (As Millennium): Yeah, I got it on discount.  Cash For Coats.

	ART (As Jake): You did not!

	AUSTIN (As Millennium): Ah, I’m fuckin’ with you.  

	ART (As Jake): [laughs]

	AUSTIN (As Millennium): Never go to that place.  So I see you— 

ART (As Jake): What a fuckin’ asshole…AUSTIN (As Millennium): [laughs] Seriously… some motherfuckers, man.  There’s three	 more of you here than I expected.

ART (As Jake): Ah, we, we caught some stragglers.  

AUSTIN (As Millennium): Safe and sound.  What’d you find out?

AUSTIN: And Jacob is like, 

AUSTIN (As Jacob): Hey!  Uh, proprietary information of the Trenton Terranormal investigation company!

ALI (As Alexa): Oh, get over yourselves.  

ART (As Jake): The Verandas did some dirt, and they tracked mud all over town.  

SYLVIA: I think Sid actually just like, pulls up the footage on the camera.

AUSTIN: Oh, yeah, uh huh [laughs]

SYLVIA: Is like, 

	SYLVIA (As Sid): I-it’s way easier to just show you this whole thing.  

ART: No, it’s way easier to talk in fun crime metaphors.  

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: Black like, looks at the footage, and, I would- Is it a special cam- does it, how… Does this work?

SYLVIA: I mean, most cameras have like, viewfinders where you can play back stuff on it…

AUSTIN: Nope, not the thing I was… hmm.

SYLVIA: Oh… sorry...

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: I was wondering if it caught weird supernatural shit!

SYLVIA: I mean, we said it caught the, like, warp to the illusory… 

AUSTIN: True, true, yeahyeahyeah, that’s fair.  Um, and so he’s just like, 

AUSTIN (As Millennium): I always knew it.  I always knew those motherfuckers were up to no good.  Never proved it, though.  I mean I knew… everybody knows the ways in which they’re up to regular no good, but this is somethin’ else.  God damn skeleton crew.  

ART (As Jake): What do you want us to do about it?

AUSTIN (As Millennium): Listen, you did your job at this point.  You can uh, turn in if you want.  You solved the case, you found… [sighs] what was causin’ the skybridge to be shut down, you uh, freed the selkie from her eternal prison, good work.  This next this, well… you wanna do that, maybe you’ll actually prove somethin’ to me.  Go a little further for the city.  I think there’s two ways of going about this.  In my experience, you’re dealing with… visions of the undead, you do what Sid said.  You go and… right the wrong.  Either you give ‘em a proper burial or you make the injustice of their lives public, you put the Verandas in the mud.  Or… you go straight to the, to the bodies themselves, put them to rest.  Directly.  Not like the... coat guy.

ALI (As Alexa): And what if we do both?  Will you support us if the Verandas come for us?

AUSTIN (As Millennium): I wish they would.

ALI (As Alexa): That’s just what I wanted to hear, boss.

ART (As Jake): It’s gotta be the other order, though, we gotta put the tape out there… so that people know, and then, we can’t, we can’t start with digging up the, the bodies, that’s a, that’s still a bad idea.  Someone’s gonna call the cops.

AUSTIN: [laughs]

AUSTIN (As Millennium): Alright, so release the tape… and uh, once it picks up steam, then you go in, that’s your plan?

ART (As Jake): Yeah, right?

AUSTIN (As Millennium): Alright.  Excited to see how this works, ha ha!

AUSTIN: And then he like, turns, and gives you a little nod, and he starts to walk away, then he turns back and looks at the Trenton team.  

	AUSTIN (As Millennium): If I ever see any of you motherfuckers in my town again, hmm?

AUSTIN: And he just kind of like, nods.  And John Paul is like [stutters].  And Jacob is like, 

	AUSTIN (As Jacob): Your town?

AUSTIN: And like, before anyone can react, Millennium Black is like, in Jacob’s face, with a speed that is not human.  

	AUSTIN (As Millennium): Ha ha!

AUSTIN: And just like, a real toothy grin.  

ART: Never mind…

AUSTIN: Well wait, I wanna know what your confessional was!

ART: It was just gonna be another one of those, like…

	ART (As Jake): Oh shit!

AUSTIN: [laughs] Yeah.  Um, and then he walks away… All my cards on the table, Millennium Black is like what if Blade stopped being a vampire hunter and started being a casino owner.  

SYLVIA: Fuckin… 

AUSTIN: Like what if he got old?

ART: Yeah, I need more Millennium Black.

ALI: I’m starting to pick up what you’re putting down [laughs].  

AUSTIN: I’m just, putting down, all the cards, all the cards on the Bluff City card table.

SYLVIA: Can he just be the main character of Bluff City now? 

AUSTIN: Um, he’s already the narrator for the first story, that’s him.  

SYLVIA: Oh!

ALI: Yeah.  

AUSTIN: So, uh, you put the video out.

ALI: Yes…

SYLVIA: Oh yeah.

AUSTIN: Gimme a— y’know, I won’t, I’m not gonna give you a technology roll, I have just like, a good idea of what happens here.  Um, nothing.  It takes months for anyone to notice, and then in October it goes viral.  Like, maybe we even get the shot of you, like, [sighs] like everyone’s stressed in the room, and you hit upload and you’re like “Any minute now, this thing’s gonna blow this whole town up”, and then it’s like, two weeks later, and then it’s like the radio show of the shitty, uh, Nathaniel Bridges, “This City’s Going To Hell” like he’s doing the audio, the radio version of his column, and he’s like, 

AUSTIN (As Nathaniel): Two weeks ago, there was a video that revealed strange skeleton people working in the Menagerie, and no one cares!  I’m tellin’ ya, this city is going to hell!

AUSTIN: And then it’s like, two months later.  Or like a month and six weeks later, and it’s the last week of October, and you’re, its just shots of you in the offices, the Gresand Paranormal offices, um, what, like, at downtime, and Orville like runs in with coffees for everybody.  Uh, and is like, 

AUSTIN (As Orville): Two billion views, two million views, yesterday we were at, we were at 87!  We’re at two million views!

ART (As Jake): The fuck happened?
[ALI and SYLVIA laugh]

	AUSTIN (As Orville): The algorithm, man… the algorithm… 

	ALI (As Alexa): No, this is great, it’s all those flyers we were giving out!

	AUSTIN (As Orville): ... maybe.  

	ALI (As Alexa): We did it!

	SYLVIA (As Sid): I mean…

AUSTIN: All of the comments are like “this is the worst shitty ARG I’ve ever seen,” like, “I can’t believe they’re making another Cloverfield movie,” “Is that Beyonce???”, question mark question mark question mark…

ALI: [sighs]

AUSTIN: So what’s the second part of this plan?  How do you wrap it up?  

ALI: Gotta go get those bodies.  Well like, probably in the meantime we’ve been like, looking up names and like, families, and like trying to figure out who’s missing?

AUSTIN: Yeah, y’know what, maybe that’s what we get is, can I actually get an academics roll for that?

ALI: Umm… hm. [laughs]

AUSTIN: Uh huh, uh huh- you have three library card, listen.  Now is the fuckin’ time to spend that library card.  

ALI: Okay, yeah.  Can I take, can I just do a roll of 3d6?

AUSTIN: Yeah totally, you can spend two of those library points if you want.  I believe, I don’t think there’s a limit to how many you can spend on a single thing.  Hey, there’s a six!

ALI: Yeah…AUSTIN: Um, so yeah, maybe what we actually get is the montage of like, 22 views, and then it’s you at the library trying to dig up information about who died, right, and like, who went missing, and who their full names are, and who was part of a construction company.  Um, and then you, it’s like, oh, you go back and it’s like 32 views, and then it’s a picture of, or it’s an image of Sid now, like, rolling through old, y’know, uh, security cam footage from when the crew was there, and then it’s like, 70 views, and then it’s an image of Jake… Jake, how do you get information about these people?

ART: Umm… Oh, um, you see like, the HR person from the casino like, walking to their car, and then you see the lights come on in a pickup truck across the parking lot and it’s Jake.  

AUSTIN: Okay.  Um, you should also be coming up with facts here, but also I think we’re wrapping, and I, I just have a good one that I’ll propose.  The names of the dead people did not, they didn’t die on that day the floor collapsed.  You find that they’ve died over the last century, maybe more, ever since the Veranda family was in the city, doing construction.  There are fifteen of them total, the most recent one died, before the, during the building of the first floor of the Menagerie casino.  But those are the names of the people you have on that tape, and you can identify them all.  They’re not just a skeleton crew, they’re a Skeleton Crew. 

ALI: So the Verandas are mobster necromancers?

AUSTIN: Y’know…

ALI: Someone’s readin’ their Vampire: The Masquerade.  

AUSTIN: Hell yeah.  

[ALI and ART laugh]

AUSTIN: Yeah, I can’t believe we fuckin’ snuck in a vampire game.  We tricked you motherfuckers, happy Halloween.  

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: Giovanni are out here.

ALI: … God... 

AUSTIN: So how do you deal with that, like where do you go?

ALI: So all on the same page here, like, for-real zombies?

AUSTIN: For- uh, skeleton people, not zombies.

ALI: Okay, rightrightright, okay.  But there’s like, still employed, or like…

AUSTIN: Yeah I think you… they’re what?

ALI: They’re like, still employed, like they are physical… 

AUSTIN: Y-yeah, they’re still physical, yeah…

ART: I don’t think they’re getting a paycheck…

AUSTIN: They are not getting a paycheck.

ALI: Okay, okay, okay.  

AUSTIN: Like I think that’s the thing you get, like, this is a thing that rich… f-families do, I guess?  Rich magic families, rich evil families, maybe they don’t even know it, maybe they have a warlock working for them that they don’t know who just keeps the books cheap, do you know what I mean?  They are just free labor, they’re just cheap free labor.  You’ll note this also happened right before Labor Day.  

ALI: Right, okay, yes, um, sorry I just wanted to, like… I just wanna make it super clear.  

AUSTIN: Yep, totally, all on, all on, super clear.

ALI: Mmhm, um, hoo boy, ummm…

ART: I don’t know how we fix this.  

ALI: Is there like an amulet that’s like… the warlock is using that we can like destroy or whatever?  Or…

ART: What about like, the Shawshank Redemption solution where we like, go in, y’know like, he like, takes his wall out in his pants, like we like kinda just start frequenting that casino and like, dribbling some holy water out of our pant legs.  
AUSTIN: [crosstalk] What does, okay…

ALI: Oh kay, okay, that’s what you mean.  [laughs]

AUSTIN: [laughs] And just like…

ART: Stealth consecrate it.

ALI: Yeah, yeah.

ART: I’m just, I’m just spitballin’ here, I dunno…

AUSTIN: I feel like, yeah, between the Director of Operations and the Chief Spiritual Officer, you should be able to figure this out.  

ALI: [sighs] yeah… 

AUSTIN: I think it is just a ritual of some sort, so tell me about what that ritual is, and we can roll it, and then see if it works.  

ALI: Yeah, I think that, mmm… 

AUSTIN: ‘Cause I don’t think it’s like, I don’t think it’s Blade, the vampire hunter, kick down the door, do some steel stakes.  Silver stakes?  Silver stakes.  

ALI: But it’s like a matter of, like, we still wanna, like…

ART: [crosstalk] Wooden stakes, what are we…

AUSTIN: He had silver stakes.  

ART: Did he?

AUSTIN: What?

ART: Those movies were a mess.

AUSTIN: Aww, no they weren’t.  Well, the first two are good. 

ART: First two are good.

AUSTIN: That’s all I gotta say about that.  

ALI: Um, I like the idea of it kind of like, them putting in effort to sort of cleanse the casino, so like the holy water idea was really good, like maybe they just like, each day one of them goes, like one of the employees sits at a different machine, and like wipes it down with like a rag, or like, with holy water on it, or like, we go there, we win, and we like, switch the chips out.

AUSTIN: Oh, that’s good…

ALI: [laughs] Like, yeah, with um…

AUSTIN: Is it with, like, a special, is it, do you work with the selkie, who I’m just gonna keep calling Beyonce until we name, um, to like, figure out how to bless certain chips.

ALI: Yeah, for sure.  Um, I think that it’s something like, so, oh god, okay, so, there’s a…

AUSTIN: Yeah, here we go, now we’re in it.  

ALI: [laughs] When you keep, um, certain, like, saltwater fish, you have to get ocean water from like a certain depth in the ocean… but I think it’s one of those things, where it’s like, it’s like, almost like, y’know, Beyonce from the Irish folklore almost gives us little missions to do, and it’s like that sort of thing, where it’s like a, like a potion, where it’s like, you have to get ocean from like 30 feet out, which is like, at the end of the pier or whatever, and then like, you have to go get like, a bunch of bird feathers or something, um…

AUSTIN: Right, rightrightright, maybe it’s like, one thing for each of the fifteen people.

ALI: Right, yeahyeahyeah.

AUSTIN: Right, where it’s like oh, and now you need to go get like, dirt from this person’s hometown, and then you need to go get, like, different stuff.  

ALI: Right, but it’s like, local, so it’s like a stone from their backyard or whatever, or like under their tree, or like yeah…

AUSTIN: Yeahyeahyeah, exactly, you’re not gettin’ on planes, y’know.  

ALI: Right, yes, or like, a rose from their garden, or like, yeahyeahyeah… 

AUSTIN: And then, you get it all.  So like, you’re sneaking it in, day by day basically?

ALI: I think so, yeah

AUSTIN: Alright, um, I think this is probably also an academics check, maybe?  I guess?  No, ‘cause that’s about, yeah, mmm, identify and solve problems, solve problems, that feels like this to me.  

ALI: Yeeeah…

ART: Is there a help mechanism here?

ALI: Yeah, do I get a bonus for that?

AUSTIN: Yes, there is a help mechanism.  The help mechanism is that you can, somebody else can roll first and you can give one of your dice to the other person.  But if you say you’re helping, you have to give one of your dice to the other person, which means a bad thing could happen if you only roll one and it’s… if you roll one dice and you’re helping, you get a zero on the roll yourself, which means I get to do a thing, to the person helping.

ART: But I have two academic dice and I would like to help.

AUSTIN: Alright, so how do you do that?

ART: I think it’s like, y’know, again, Jake isn’t objectively stupid on this stuff, but he’s the worst of the bunch, I think he’s like, he’s bringing the right books, he’s bringing, you know, he’s managing the coffee machine, which is a bit of a doing… I think that’s how he’s helping, y’know, he’s like highlighting books before Alexa gets them, stuff like that.

AUSTIN: Yeah, okay, give me a, give me the dice roll.

ART: So I roll one and the- I roll first?

AUSTIN: No, you roll two, you roll two.  And then you ch— 

ART: I roll both of them.  

AUSTIN: You roll both of them.  

ART: Oh, I give one, okay.  

AUSTIN: You give one, exactly.  Alright, so do you give the five or the two?

ALI: [laughs]

ART: I’ll give the five.  

AUSTIN: Alright, so… oh buddy.  We’ll come back to the bad thing for you once we’re done.  

ALI: Okay, I just roll, and then we’ll see what it is?

AUSTIN; Yeah, you roll the thing that you roll, and you have at least a five, basically.  So hey, you get a five.  Alright, so you manage to do this thing, um… what’s it look like?  What’s the final step, and what’s it… wrap up this whole ritual for me.  I think maybe one piece of context is like, there are protestors who are like, yelling outside, who have signs and who have pickets, who are like “You can’t bury the truth!”... nothing rhymes with truth, fuck… uh, “Skeleton labor’s uncouth!”.  

ART: There you go.AUSTIN: But they don’t do that, that’s bad.

ART: What are you talkin’ about?

AUSTIN: ‘Cause I think most, I think most people when they watch that footage are like “Oh yeah, those are skeleton people,” like, that opened up a thing and it was like “oh, that was a weird video that some like, protest activists made to say that this casino is working people to death, and that there was this event where people got hurt”, and so most people think like “oh yeah, people got hurt when they built that second level of the floor”, and you know actually, they’re using weird skeleton slaves, who I’m freeing.  

ALI: It sucks ‘cause like, I don’t want the final scene of this to be like, ten skeletons walk out of this casino, maybe like [laughs]...

AUSTIN: Me either, but…

ALI: Um, I, yeah, I don’t know if it’s like, but it also shouldn’t be like, they fade away and it’s fine, um… maybe they like, come back alive?

AUSTIN: … Huh.

ART: Woah.  

ALI: Um, and they only have…

AUSTIN: Resurrected.

ALI: I resurrected them, but it’s like, they only have… like 24 hours, and they know that they only have 24 hours.  

AUSTIN: Oh, that’s kinda good.  Oh, that’s kinda good and really sad.  But good.

ALI: Yeah, so they can kinda make peace, whatever the thing that they wanted to make peace with, and then they know that they don’t just have to be like, an alive person again… um

AUSTIN: And like, right, yes.  

ALI: Right, ‘cause they, y’know, they’ve kinda, y’know, they have like the night, they, for themselves, but like…

AUSTIN: They get a big dinner together.

ALI: Yeah…

AUSTIN: And they also go and like, do the thing of like, look at your grandkid who is now and adult and like, has a family of their own, and like, they go in the water for the first time in ages, they go swimming, 

DRE: Aww...

AUSTIN: And one of them rides the ferris wheel, um, and is like “the city’s gotten, the city’s gotten so big”. 
ALI: Aww…

AUSTIN: And one of them orders just like, the biggest, juiciest steak they’ve ever had, um, they’ve ever seen, and then like, it’s taken care of by the black, uh, by the Black Colossus hotel, like they just pay for it, like I think everyone’s in on this, y’know what I mean,

ALI: Yeah, for sure.  

AUSTIN: Like they make, Mr. Black makes sure that this is, that they’re all taken care of for this last day.  

ALI: Yeah, there’s definitely like, a shot of one of them sitting on a bench on the boardwalk, like eating an, uh, an italian ice.

AUSTIN: Uh huh, yes, totally… and also a funnel cake, and also has saltwater taffy, and is just like “I love this city, I fuckin’ love this city”... Um, and… one person just gets in a car, and just drives west as far as they can, and they never wanna see this city again.  And one of them, I think, is like “I don’t wanna go”, and insists on being allowed to stay and help you stop things like this from happening in the future.  

ALI: [sighs]

ART: Can we do that?SYLVIA: Hell yes.

ALI: I will do anything in my power to arrange that.  
AUSTIN: All right.  Um, and I think, the selkie also is sticking around, obviously?  I think maybe what she says is like… um… alright I’ve made a decision, I’ve made a unilateral decision about the selkie, a thing she’s done over five hundred years is collect a bunch of treasure and hide it somewhere in the ocean.  Um, like, she’s just like, every time there’s ever been a shipwreck, any time any ship’s ever gone missing, she’s found it and taken stuff from it, and she’s like, I think she’s just gone, one day, and then like, she comes back dressed to the nines, and is just like… a second person we’ll have to deal with in this setting in the future?  We should come up with a real name for her, that isn’t just “the selkie” or “Beyonce”.

ALI: [laughs] When she comes back up again we’ll…

AUSTIN: Yeah, we’ll have a real name for her.  Um, and… yeah, and then we just get the last of them, maybe there’s a couple of them who hang out together, I think we just get like, a couple of them looking at the casino, looking at the Menagerie, one of them spits on the ground, and the other person says like “Hey, we built this fuckin’ thing. We did this”.  And the other guy is like “You’re damn right”.  And then the sun rises, and we just get like, we don’t see them fizzle away, we don’t see them fade, we just get the close-up of like, “You’re damn right” and the sun like, starts moving up their bodies, and then we just get a quiet wide shot of the front of the Menagerie, and just says like “The Menagerie”, and no one is there, and it’s just the boardwalk, and you hear a seagull in the background, cawing… Somewhere along the way, Jake, you read the wrong book.  You used to do this promo, where you would just like, channel what you thought a death god sounded like.

ART: Mmm.  Yeah, that’s a… 

AUSTIN: Um, and you got it in you again.  Except you know the right words this time.  And it’s not the sort of death god that’s like, out to collect or out to do vengeance or out to… you’re not the grim reaper now, but you have this like, urge to put yourself into really dangerous places, and you start getting the itch again, to get back in the ring.  

ART: MMMmmm…

AUSTIN: What do we get from Alexa and Sid?  I guess there’s actually, there’s a rule for this, nevermind… 

ALI: Oh is there?

AUSTIN: Yeah, there’s vacation.   

ALI: [gasp]

AUSTIN: This game ends on vacation, which is the best thing… Uh, actually, so first of all, you get, actually you’re gonna get… you can’t get more than fourteen score, so you get fourteen franchise score, which what we would do at this point is spend those on library card, gym card, credit card, bank.  Like, that’s just money for the next adventure, that’s how that works, that’s how you level up in this game, which is really cool.  ART: Alright, we should let the next people who play figure that out, right?

AUSTIN: Oh absolutely, but what there also is is vacation, um… This stage is meant to be short and sweet.  You can end the game right after vacation, or you can continue right into another job.  It is midnight, we are ending this game.  Uh, an interesting game could arrive from something that happens on vacation, blah blah blah blah blah.  If you’re suffering from a stress-related penalty, you can now get back some or all of your dice by removing dice from the bank, or by spending franchise dice you earned at the end of the mission.  One dice restores one point to a skill.  Um, if you’re still stressed and you have no bank dice left to spend, you must spend your own cool dice.  If you have nothing left, you’re screwed for the time being, and your stress penalties stick around for the next game session.  Just breathe deep and start chewing those antacids.  So, you can spend this franchise score to get your points back, so how many points are we down, one, two three, four, five, six?  Six.  That’s not so bad.

02:30:00

ART: Yeah, that would still put us pretty, pretty well.  

AUSTIN: Yeah.  So, depending on how many points you need to spend, it shows how far your, your vacation is, how long your vacation is to recover.

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: So, uh, Jake’s, Jake, you only lost one, so that is one day.  

ART: I’m back to work...

AUSTIN: Sid, you lost, you lost one also, so it’s back to work for you, that’s one for you.  Alexa, one two, three four, right?

ALI: Uh huh!

AUSTIN: You get two weeks, you have to take two weeks off to fuckin’ chill.  What do you do on your two-week vacation?ALI: Umm…

AUSTIN: Wait, briefly, Sid, is the thing with you just like, you have to go to school the day after this shit?  So like, you don’t even get...

SYLVIA: Basically, I think.

ART: I mean, after this, doesn’t school kinda feel like a vacation?

SYLVIA: No… No, no…. 

ART: Ah?

SYLVIA: I got to hang out with a skeleton.

AUSTIN: Haha, aww… 

SYLVIA: School is so much worse.  

AUSTIN: Sid… alright, Alexa, two weeks off, right?  Two weeks off in November, what’s that look like?

ALI: Ooh… I think that it’s like, a lot of like, relaxing, um, I think she like stays in her house a lot…

AUSTIN: It’s like a stay-cation?  

ALI: Yeah, but I think that she, um, like, goes to a jeweler in town, and gets the aquamarine she was holding crafted into an actual, like, cut jewel, and then makes a, uh, necklace for Beyonce with it.  AUSTIN: I think Beyonce opens up, like, a mystical shop on the boardwalk, like an oddities and like, crystals, and like, y’know, you’ve been to those boardwalk shops before, right?

ALI: Yeah.

ART: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Like you walk inside and it just smells like incense and like, there’s a cool lady there who was maybe a hippie once and now definitely knows like, a little bit of witchcraft… it’s her, it’s Beyonce in this, that’s what she’s doing— but is also like a fixer for weird paranormal stuff and like, has the pulse of what’s happening here, and it’s definitely also a weird front for other shit she has going on, um…

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: And like she wears it, and, and… I think she like, checks it first, to make sure that it’s not another chain, that it’s another like, prison.  She like puts some, she grinds up some herbs into a powder, and very quickly just rubs them on it, and it shines really bright.  And she just like smiles at you, and says,

	AUSTIN (As Selkie): I had to check.  

	ALI (As Alexa): I understand.

AUSTIN: And she puts it on.  And then yeah, we also get Sid with the skeleton, like, detective, um, on a case.  And then Jake, what about you, what’s the final Jake shot?

SYLVIA: Oh actually, mmm.

AUSTIN: Sid, go ahead.  

SYLVIA: I actually have a better idea for the final shot for Sid, 

AUSTIN: Yes, yes…

SYLVIA: Where it’s her, back at school at like a Halloween party with her girlfriend, and she’s just really drunk trying to tell people about what happened.  

AUSTIN: [laughs] God…

SYLVIA: Her Halloween costume is Harry Trauman from Twin Peaks and her girlfriend is Dale Cooper.  It’s very good.

AUSTIN: That’s incredibly good.

ART: Um, I think the last Jake shot starts in the office, and you got like, um, y’know Orville’s working at the coffee machine, probably some employees that we haven’t seen yet, so I don’t wanna describe ‘em too much, but you just hear this like, “BAM, BAM,” and the camera like pans up to like, the attic, or the room, the second floor, it’s probably not a full attic, and it’s just Jake just like, hittin’ on a heavy bag, he’s trying to get back into shape.
