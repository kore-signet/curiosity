KEITH (as Gig): Hey ev- hey everybody! Welcome to the ship! This is a whole new ship! Um… what’s our ship called again? Grand Mag… Grand Magnificent, what’s our ship called?
 
ART (as Grand): Oh… I didn’t know you were actually asking. [crosstalk] Ah, yeah it’s—
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] I was well… [chuckling] I wasn’t actually asking.
 
ART (as Grand): Ah, it’s the World Without End.
 
KEITH (as Gig): This is the World Without End, it’s a big ship with all our friends on it. Not all our friends! You guys are also my friends. Um… But what do we do… on the ship?
 
ART (as Grand): Um, well I don’t think it’s super clear yet. We’re gonna be uh- just trying to help some people out!
 
KEITH (as Gig): Okay… I can do that. They told me I could build stuff for people, so I’ll do that. And you can do… [crosstalk] I guess a different sort…
 
ART (as Grand): Well not that.
 
KEITH (as Gig): …a different sort of building?
 
ART (as Grand): Probably not.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Probably not? Okay. Um… but we’re back from a break, we were on a big break. Can I ask you a couple questions?
 
ART (as Grand): Of course!
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s your perfect weekend?
 
ART (as Grand): I don’t… I haven’t had a weekend in a long time. I don’t- I don’t really know. Um… I… I don’t know, maybe just hanging out with some coworkers? And um, trying to… you know… catch a game or something?
 
KEITH (as Gig): What kind of game?
 
ART (as Grand): You know, future sports.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [to Even] Even, Even Gardner!
 
DRE (as Even): Hey! This is-
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] What’s your favorite… what’s your perfect weekend?
 
DRE (as Even): Um… uh… gosh, um… so… me and my, uh- my friend Cascabel have been watching this new show. It’s not… It’s not something I normally get into so it’s kind of a… kind of a guilty pleasure thing? I think.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [interested] Oh…
 
DRE (as Even): But uh… yeah! So that’s fun, [crosstalk] we’ll hang out.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] What’s the show?
 
DRE (as Even): It’s like… [sighs] it’s- it’s like this drama about these kids who are in high school.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [pause] What do they do in high school? [crosstalk] What’s the name of the show?
 
DRE (as Even): [crosstalk] They uh… It is uh… oh gosh… [stuttering] It-it-you- Like if I say it, is that weird advertising stuff for you? [crosstalk] Or is that like good advertising stuff for you? Is there- wait.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] Nnnnnnnn… no I just think it’s just people wanna know what you’re watching.
 
DRE (as Even): Okay… okay… shit.
 
KEITH (as Gig): People like you! People wanna know what you’re doing.
 
DRE (as Even): Yeah it’s uh… yeah! It’s called uh- called Huckleberry High [KEITH chuckles]
 
KEITH (as Gig): Fourteen Fifteen!
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Hi!
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s your perfect weekend?
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Oh um… I’ve um… I’ve been trying to… [chuckling] I’ve been trying to plant a garden? And I think I- if I wanted to say the romantic answer it’d be like gardening? But it’s really— there’s nothing coming up. Uh, there’s nothing there yet, so it’s not really much of a garden. I think maybe, if I go into town? And I’m surprised by people who are there, people who I haven’t seen in a while. And like...
 
KEITH (as Gig): Ah, okay.
 
JACK (as Fourteen): That’s always— that’s always really nice!
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah, seeing your friends and planting- planting some seeds.
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Or trying to.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Right. [pause] Grand Magnificent, who’s someone you really admire?
 
ART (as Grand): Hm… I don’t… don’t… don’t…
 
KEITH (as Gig): Don’t?
 
ART (as Grand): Don’t like… who’s going to see this?
 
KEITH (as Gig): A lot of… a lot of people. I don’t wanna brag.
 
ART (as Grand): I mean like, who that we know is gonna see this?
 
KEITH (as Gig): Who do you admire that you don’t want knowing you admire them?
 
ART (as Grand): Don’t worry about it. Um… but like, Even.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [genuinely] That’s sweet, I don’t think Even will see it. [pause] Even, what’s uh… who’s someone you really admire?
 
DRE (as Even): Uh… Man. Um… I think- I think I… Echo. You know. Echo got dealt kind of a rough hand, and I didn’t really… agree with some of the stuff that happened to them and kind of how their home ship was run. Um… I don’t know, I felt like they always tried to make the best of things, and that they’ve always had a very clear kind of idea of- of who they are and what they wanna do with themselves. Um… and I respect that, a lot.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Who’s someone you really admire?
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Uh… I like, a while ago I did a couple of jobs with Signet? Who I haven’t really been… I haven’t really seen in a while. Uh, other than like in the last few days which has been great. But, I was always… I really admire how Signet… Signet seems to find th-the… the good in things and the good in people? And finds the way to follow that- to like follow that path. Um… which is cool as hell. But, you know, also Morning’s Observation cause he’s really funny and cool and we apprehended him in a sort of weird version of the Olympics? [KEITH laughs] But he turned out to be great, and I’m really into that. That’s cool as hell.
 
[pause]
 
KEITH (as Gig): Grand Magnificent, what’s your best color?
 
ART (as Grand): Pfft... I’m pretty great in every color.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Every color? Pick one. [ART blows air through his lips] The other colors won’t be upset.
 
ART (as Grand): Alright. You ever like? Been on the beach, and the- the sun is setting, and it’s been a real clear day and you get that just… that orange color that’s not quite like any orange color?
 
KEITH (as Gig): Mm-hmm, yeah.
 
ART (as Grand): Yeah, that one.
 
KEITH (as Gig): That’s a good one!
 
ART (as Grand): Thanks.
  
KEITH (as Gig): What’s your best color?
 
DRE (as Even): [sighs] You know I don’t really like… pay attention to like colors of stuff that I wear? But… lately if I’m… driving something? I want it to be red.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Red looks fast.
 
DRE (as Even): Yeah, exactly!
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s your best color?
 
JACK (as Fourteen): I’m sorry?
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s your best color?
 
JACK (as Fourteen): What’s my favorite color?
 
KEITH (as Gig): No, your best color.
 
JACK (as Fourteen): What-
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s your most you-color!
 
JACK (as Fourteen): The color I wear best?
 
KEITH (as Gig): N- Yeah, sure, yeah!
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Or like the color that is best. I’ve just- I’ve been doing these like… [stuttering] Something that’s very important in the law is the specificity of words, I’ve been learning that. It’s something that wasn’t very important to me for very long, so I just want to make sure that we’re on the same page here.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Okay. [carefully] What is the color that makes you feel like you’re killing it when you… wear it… or, Even gave me an answer where he’s driving it in a car, so that too.
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Blue.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Regular blue? True blue?
 
JACK (as Fourteen): [stuttering] There’s lots of different kinds of blue!
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah, you said specificity, what kind of blue?
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Ah. [laughing] Ah! So you’ve kind of caught me in a little trap.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [in the background] Mm-hmm!
 
JACK (as Fourteen): I’d say probably… probably sort of a rich… probably sort of a rich mid-blue.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Okay… mint blue or mid blue? [crosstalk] Like middle blue.
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Mid, mid.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Mid, okay. [small pause] What’s your most prized possession?
 
ART (as Grand): [exhales] You’re… you’re gonna think this is silly.
 
KEITH (as Gig): I promise that I will not.
 
ART (as Grand): Alright… I got this… I got this thing made. It’s a picture of… of all of us from Quire on the first day. You remember- you remember when posed for that picture?
 
KEITH (as Gig): I remember!
 
ART (as Grand): Yeah, I just thought it’d be nice, and that was such- that’s such an important moment to me, like getting to where we are now. I just w- I really wanted to remember that I keep it with me all the time.
 
KEITH (as Gig): That’s so nice!
 
ART (as Grand): Yeah… Thanks for not making fun of me.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Of course, no, I wouldn’t. [pause] What’s your most prized possession?
 
DRE (as Even): Uh… Okay, alright, well. Okay, I’m gonna get it out, but I want you to turn… I need you to like, pause the recording before I let like I show you where I keep it.
 
KEITH (as Gig): What do you mean, you want me to not, you want me to censor it out?
 
DRE (as Even): Well, I’ll show you what it is! But like, I kinda keep it hidden up here in the cockpit.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Do you… okay I’ll… shut my eyes.
 
DRE (as Even): Okay um… alright, so… okay you can open your eyes!
 
KEITH (as Gig): Okay.
 
DRE (as Even): It’s uh… [laughs] you know, I haven’t even tried doing this since uh… you know all those kind of changes? Happened? For me?
 
KEITH (as Gig): Mm-hmm.
 
DRE (as Even): But um… when I first started learning how to fly, I had this commander who was like really into like, “Ah whenever you, whenever you come back safe it’s worth celebrating,” and so he bought these… godawful, terrible cigars, and he would make us smoke them. Um… and they-
 
KEITH (as Gig): Oh, you mean fly ships! Not fly… [crosstalk] with your body.
 
DRE (as Even): Yeah yeah, oh [crosstalk] yeah. Yeah, no. Well, yeah the wing stuff is… you were there when that happened. [crosstalk] I didn’t have the most…
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah, yeah- yeah.
 
DRE (as Even): So yeah, it’s these uh… these victory cigars. I still got a couple that- that he uh… that he gave to me before I set off down to Quire. They’ve- they probably taste and smell awful, but you know, maybe when… maybe when this is over we can light them and share them.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Do cigars age well? Is that like something where it’s like, oh this is a nice old…
 
DRE (as Even): Nope!
 
KEITH (as Gig): Nope, okay! [chuckling] Yeah let’s try them! [pause] What’s your most prized possession?
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Um… It’s… [sighs] It’s my old gun, which is like… I feel a bit… I feel a bit weird saying that? Because… [sighs] you know when you’re a hitman? And-and-and [crosstalk] you have sort of a signature? You-
 
KEITH (as Gig): [in the background] Yeah! Yep.
 
JACK (as Fourteen): [laughs] Uh-huh? Sorry, I mean, I just… [crosstalk] I don’t…
 
KEITH (as Gig): [amused] I know when you were a hitman, yeah.
 
JACK (as Fourteen): I don’t know… what I mean to say there. When I was a hitman, and you sort of a signature weapon, and that weapon sort of becomes part of you, it’s sort of uh- I would change so much and I still would always come back to this weapon. And now if I fire it, um… I think it’ll explode? Uh…
 
KEITH (as Gig): [in the background] Yeah!
 
JACK (as Fourteen): So-so uh… which is great! Cause I have an incentive not to fire it, cause- cause I don’t want to fire it, but I also don’t want to throw it away? So I just keep it in my… in my bunk.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Mm-hmm.
 
JACK (as Fourteen): I keep it safe. I know I’m gonna- I’m probably gonna have to fire it again one day, but I want to make sure it’s… you know. You’ve only got- you’ve only got one shot before the very special gun explodes.
 
KEITH (as Gig): That’s what they say, now.
 
JACK (as Fourteen): That’s- yeah! [crosstalk] [chuckling] I guess that’s what they say!
 
KEITH (as Gig): You’ve only got one shot before your special gun explodes… now.
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Yeah I’ve heard people say that all over.
 
[pause]
 
KEITH (as Gig): Who’s your favorite horse on the ship?
 
ART (as Grand): How many horses… [crosstalk] I just- I just don’t think I’ve been here very long.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] One. There’s one. Who’s your favorite?
 
ART (as Grand): Um… It’s- it’s… it’s Duck? Duck’s [crosstalk] my favorite horse.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] Who’s your favorite horse on the ship?
 
DRE (as Even): I don’t- is this a thing where I’m just supposed to say your horse [crosstalk] because…
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] [amused] Who’s your favorite horse on the ship?
 
DRE (as Even): Listen, Duck’s a pretty good horse, I can’t lie.
 
KEITH (as Gig): And who’s your favorite on the ship, though?
 
DRE (as Even): I… Duck. Duck the very… good horse. Who I guess I now have more in common with. [sound of blowing air] How do you- how do you… how do you groom your horse’s like head tendrils.
 
KEITH (as Gig): They… self-clean.
 
DRE (as Even): Oh.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Like a cat.
 
DRE (as Even): Ahhhh, okay, [AUSTIN laughs] we’re done.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Who’s your favorite horse on the ship?
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Duck! Obviously!
 
KEITH (as Gig): Duck! I almost said who’s your favorite duck on the ship. [crosstalk] Answer’s still Duck. Yeah! [laughs]
 
JACK (as Fourteen): [crosstalk] I mean, I would’ve given you the same answer. Yeah! Would’ve still have been Duck. He’s great!
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah…
 
JACK (as Fourteen): What a thing! You found him in like uh, [crosstalk] in like a weird…
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] What a thing… He was in like a miniature iceberg at a museum.
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Holy lord!
 
KEITH (as Gig): I know, no one down there knew what was up with him either.
 
JACK (as Fourteen): No one up here knows what’s up with him, he’s weird well! [crosstalk] I love him!
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] Yeah, he’s weird as well, he’s the best.
 
AUSTIN (as Duck): [animal foley] Mmmmmgmmmm… Gig!
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah.
 
AUSTIN (as Duck): Mmm.. Gig!
 
KEITH (as Gig): Oh! Duck.
 
AUSTIN (as Duck): Mm- Duck.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Duck. [crosstalk] Good horse.
 
JACK (as Fourteen): [crosstalk] He’s so great!
 
AUSTIN (as Duck): [in the background] Mmgmm…
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah. High five!
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Oh my god.
 
[pause, the sound of clapping]
 
JACK (as Fourteen): [laughing] Holy heck.
 
[KEITH and AUSTIN laugh really hard]
 
JACK (as Fourteen): That’s amazing!
 
KEITH (as Gig): [amused] I know. Super talented, and like, can talk! So, pretty cool.
 
AUSTIN (as Duck): Great!
 
[small pause]
 
KEITH (as Gig): What was the most fun you’ve had this year?
 
ART (as Grand): I don’t know… it’s been kind of a rough year? Uh… I guess like… I sort of- that first day of work when I looked around and realized that I was surrounded by… people that I could count on. That we had built something good.
 
KEITH (as Gig): …Good! First day of work you mean?
 
ART (as Grand): Not like the first day of work, like the first day [crosstalk] the first day that-
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] Oh the first that happened, that you [crosstalk] had that feeling.
 
ART (as Grand): [crosstalk] Yeah, the first day that those conditions were true.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Okay, cool. [pause] What was the... what, where am I? What was the most fun you had this year?
 
DRE (as Even): Okay, alright, check this out. Alright.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Okay.
 
DRE (as Even): See my hands [crosstalk] I’m not touching…
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] Is it more cigars?
 
DRE (as Even): No. No. See I’m not touching anything on the ship? [KEITH affirming] Like I’m not touching controls or anything?
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah.
 
DRE (as Even): Alright now see. Alright I’m just gonna take this one piece of hair, and it’s gonna touch the roof of the cockpit?
 
KEITH (as Gig): Mm-hmm.
 
DRE (as Even): And now… the engine’s on!
 
KEITH (as Gig): [pause] You got a remote starter put into your hair?
 
DRE (as Even): No… I learned that I can connect to things with my brain? And fly them?
 
KEITH (as Gig): Oh…
 
DRE (as Even): Which is… I gotta say, man. [crosstalk] Pr…
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] The most fun you’ve had all year?
 
DRE (as Even): Yeah. Do you know how much easier it is to pull like, corkscrews and Immelmanns when your hands aren’t slowing you down.
 
KEITH (as Gig): No, I don’t!
 
DRE (as Even): [crosstalk] Yeah.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] I don’t even know how to pull an… Immel…mann.
 
DRE (as Even): I can teach you sometime.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Okay. What is the general motion of an Immelmann?
 
DRE (as Even): It’s uh… it’s kind of you do almost like a U-turn in mid-air. But then you also have to like, do a rotation to make sure your ship doesn’t stay upside down.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Oh, it’s a tray-flip?
 
DRE (as Even): A… a what?
 
KEITH (as Gig): It’s a skateboard move where you do a pop shove-it and a kickflip at the same time.
 
DRE (as Even): I don’t… okay I teach you how to do an Immelmann and you teach me to skateboard.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Okay.
 
[pause]
 
DRE (as Even): [amused] Okay Gig, I can teach you to do an Immelmann. But I think in return, you have to teach me how to skateboard. [pause] Okay, I can teach you how to Immelmann. 
15:00
Like it’s going to be hard, it’s not like a rookie thing… [genuinely] but I really want you to teach me how to skateboard. [pause] [jokingly] Uh, yeah I can teach you to do an Immelmann, but you gotta teach me to skateboard!
 
[pause]

KEITH (as Gig): What was the most fun you had this year?
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Um, Moonlock isn’t super hospital?  It… It’s fairly hospital. There could be worse places. But uh, I didn’t think it’d be the sort of place that I would find this really great sort of— sort of swimming hole… swimming creek. Um… I went swimming with a few of my friends from town. I- I don’t think you’ve met them. Um… I hope they’re doing okay, actually! [crosstalk] It was- it was just-
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] Are these the friends from town from before?
 
JACK (as Fourteen): These are the friends from town from before!
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] Oh that’s nice.
 
JACK (as Fourteen): I think I’m probably just… I didn’t get to say goodbye to them in the way that I wanted to. I’ll send them a message or something, it’s- they’re easy… it’s all chill. But you know, it’d be good to see them. Anyway we went swimming and it was really good.
 
[pause]
 
KEITH (as Gig): If you could have any food right now what would it be?
 
ART (as Grand): You know, I haven’t had a good meatball sandwich in a damn long time.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Oh yeah meatball… like a meatball parm?
 
ART (as Grand): I mean, I don’t think the cheese is that important.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] It’s the meat.
 
ART (as Grand): [crosstalk] It’s really about the crust and the bread and that the sauce isn’t too sweet. But like, if they only got meatball parm I’ll have meatball parm.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Well, all you gotta do is not have the parm.
 
ART (as Grand): And some places don’t do hold the parm!
 
KEITH (as Gig): [incredulous] Really?
 
ART (as Grand): Yeah like, if you… if it’s just like in a steam tray and they— the cheese is either on it or it’s not.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Oh b- I had no idea that there was a version of the world where you couldn’t get a parmless meatball parm.
 
ART (as Grand): We come from different worlds.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [chuckling] I guess. [pause] If you could have any food right now what would it be?
 
DRE (as Even): Oh okay… so that’s…. [sighs] that’s kind of a bummer question Gig. So like, all of this has been- has been pretty cool and different. But like, I don’t really… taste stuff… anymore. [crosstalk] Like I still need to eat, but I don’t taste things anymore.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] That’s… that’s a nightmare!
 
DRE (as Even): I mean… you kinda get used to it. In some ways it’s kind of like, I guess— it’s not better but in some w- but like, it’s more convenient. Cause like, you know, like if I order a cheeseburg— what’s something you hate to get on your cheeseburger?
 
KEITH (as Gig): Um… man, I’m kinda up for anything. I guess oli- black olives.
 
DRE (as Even): Okay, alright. So yeah, if you ordered something that was- you said no black olives and it came, like, you’re not like a rude guy I don’t- I’m not saying you would make like a stink about it. But I don’t know man, I could just shovel it all in and I wouldn’t care.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah, you wouldn’t even have to- to say no olives.
 
DRE (as Even): Yeah, I could just be like, “yeah, sure whatever.”
 
KEITH (as Gig): Bring me you’re- bring me you’re most calorie dense options!
 
DRE (as Even): Yeah! [laughs wheezingly]
 
KEITH (as Gig): Bring me the most calorically efficient food you have!
 
DRE (as Even): Yeah, you know, again when you put it that way it starts getting more depressing [KEITH laughs] I’m trying to look on the positive side here!
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah, okay, that’s fair. You like to at least look at a burger.
 
DRE (as Even): Yeah!
 
KEITH (as Gig): Um, if you could at any food right now what would it be?
 
DRE (as Even): [laughs hard] Ah… um… man, there was, ah this really good salad I had once that had like, just a bunch of fresh fruit and good goat cheese and like… I don’t know.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Oh goat cheese and strawberries? [crosstalk] That’s delicious.
 
DRE (as Even): [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah. Man, that was a good salad.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Uh, if you could have any food right now, what would it be?
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Um, I think maybe some kind of like… [sighs] Some kind of like a skewer, with really like fresh vegetables, like cooked over a barbeque or cooked over hot coals or something, so that you get the like really nice grill marks on the vegetables.
 
KEITH (as Gig): A smoky pepper?
 
JACK (as Fourteen): A smoky pepper… they don’t have those on Moonlock. But, yeah a smoky pepper would be great.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Hey Grand, do you wanna shout out someone who’s had your back?
 
ART (as Grand): Uh yeah! Um… Echo saved my life in a really rough situation down on Quire, and I’ve forgotten that, and it’s- it was a really important, transitive moment for me, yeah.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Even.
 
DRE (as Even): Yeah!
 
KEITH (as Gig): Do you wanna give a shout out to someone who’s had your back?
 
DRE (as Even): Ah… hm… yeah! I wanna give a shout out to… Cascabel!
 
KEITH (as Gig): How come?
 
DRE (as Even): Um… well I mean, he was with me when we did all that stuff against… against Independence, and uh… I don’t know! As I’ve been going through all these- these kinda changes this past year he’s been a pretty… a pretty good presence to kinda help me… you know figure all this stuff out.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Fourteen Fifteen? Do you wanna give a shout out to someone who’s had your back?
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Yeah! Uh, I’d like to give a shout out to Tender Sky. Um, who I’ve worked with like a lot, and I’m excited to work with again… uh, Tender is very good at um… [sighs] things don’t exactly go smoothly? I think I’d be lying if I said Tender is very good at making sure things go smoothly. [KEITH laughs] But she is very good at uh… once things haven’t gone smoothly, extricating from that situation. Uh, and I appreciate that a lot.
 
[pause]
 
KEITH (as Gig): Do you like falling asleep or waking up better?
 
ART (as Grand): Oh, definitely falling asleep. Um… I really just- I love that feeling of drifting off. I like the way that your mind can wander in those last moments. Waking up is just like a reminder that you have stuff to do.
 
KEITH (as Gig): That’s called something, you know what that’s called?
 
ART (as Grand): No.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Hypno- hypnogosia. Hypnogosia? [crosstalk]
 
ART (as Grand): [crosstalk] W-what is.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Hypnagogia? That’s that feeling of being like, sort of half-awake half-asleep and having weird semi-half-dreams? [ART makes an affirming noise] You like hypnogosia.
 
ART (as Grand): Okay. [KEITH laughs] Good to know. Now I’m hip to hypnogosia. [KEITH laughs hard.]
 
KEITH (as Gig): Uh… Even, do you like falling asleep or waking up better?
 
DRE (as Even): Ah man, I feel like I’m just gonna make all these- all your segments a bummer Gig, cause I don’t really sleep anymore.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Like not even for fun?
 
DRE (as Even): N-no… I mean, I definitely have moments where like, if I… so if I’m like flying a ship overnight or something I’ll kind of like… I don’t know, I guess it’s like almost like meditating, you know. [KEITH makes an affirming noise] Where I’ll kind of like, I’ll lose some awareness of my, where my physical space ends and where the ship starts? And [crosstalk] there’s like a…
 
KEITH (as Gig): Okay, here, how’s a new question. Do you prefer entering into or leaving a meditative state?
 
DRE (as Even): Oh… um… I think leaving. It’s not like a bad place to be but there’s something kind of… I don’t know, there’s something kind of reassuring of like, coming back from that and being like and being very like- it’s like uh… it’s like I become like cognizant of like, my different senses one by one. Like, first I’ll kind of blink my eyes and things will come into focus, and then I’ll hear the hum of the ship, and then I’ll feel the seat that I’m sitting in. I don’t know, there’s something kind of like calming about, I don’t know, almost like… pieces of yourself are like coming back one by one.
 
[pause]

KEITH (as Gig): What do you like better, falling asleep or waking up?
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Waking up. You know where you are when you wake up. Most of the time
 
KEITH (as Gig): [laughing] Yeah!
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Uh…
 
KEITH (as Gig): Waking up where you don’t know where you are is maybe the pits.
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Yeah… It happens to me more often than I would like. But uh… y-you kind of… it’s something you get used to, it’s something you fortify yourself for. I was never a morning person when I was younger um… I don’t think. And, uh… but then I must have gotten good at it because now the mornings are— the mornings are great! I get up early, I make breakfast, maybe that’s something to do with the fact that I… you know. I might not know where I’ll be the next day , but that’s fine! It’s a- it’s a skill that you practice.

[pause]

KEITH (as Gig): Grand Magnificent, we’re starting a new job, but what’s your next job gonna be?
 
ART (as Grand): Heh. Ah… I don’t know that I want a next job.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Just this? Just only this? Okay, yeah, totally. Um. What’s your next job gonna be?
 
DRE (as Even): [sighs] I don’t know Gig. I’m getting kinda old, man. I- I think I want my next job to be like, just, sitting back lighting up one of those cigars and just being able to look at all the good stuff that we got done together.
 
KEITH (as Gig): You know you’re not gonna be able to taste how bad those cigars are.
 
DRE (as Even): I know- and- it’s gonna be a blessing. Silver linings.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [chuckles] Can you get the heat from it?
 
DRE (as Even): Yeah! Yeah. Yeah, and I’ll probably like, be able to feel the smoke and stuff like that.
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s your next job going to be?
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Probably the law. I think. I’m like a... I’m a baby lawyer now. I’m a much better— [Everyone starts to crack up] I’m a much— [KEITH, AUSTIN, ART, and DRE laugh really hard, JACK starts to join in] Sorry. [crosstalk] Oh you’ll just laugh it—
 
AUSTIN: He said he was a baby lawyer! He said—
 
AUSTIN (as Morning’s Observation): Yo, what’s good? Morning’s Observation you already know what it is. Shout outs to the whole Twilight Mirage. Yo, uh… you’re not a baby lawyer you have like horns. Babies don’t have horns. [KEITH laughs] [crosstalk] Step one.
 
ART: [crosstalk] I think they meant a lawyer for babies.
 
JACK (as Fourteen): [crosstalk] Okay. I— I didn’t know you were here. Did you— I complimented you earlier. Were you not around for that?
 
AUSTIN (as Morning’s Observation): I- Y-You have to cut this from whatever this is I’m not supposed to be here right now, I think I’m supposed to be cooking breakfast sandwiches, but I saw an opportunity, uh… you know I’m a… what do we call that, I’m a Stratus I can be places. I can be a bunch of places at once, that’s my power I guess now. That’s canon, put it on a Wikipedia page!
 
JACK (as Fourteen): Yeah, no. I think it'd be naïve to say that there’s gonna come a point where we're finished, where we can say, “The work is done.” [chuckling] The Notion is over, but I would like there to be a point where- where I stop having to run around. And- and hit people. And I can start sitting behind a desk and making sure that the people who need it are getting the help, you know, on a much smaller scale? And see if the plants in the garden come up? I don’t know.
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’d you plant?
 
JACK (as Fourteen): I planted potatoes, cause they’re easy. I-I’ve never grown a garden before. Um, I planted potatoes. I planted carrots. I planted onions. Uh… I planted marrows, [chuckling] but I think that’s a mistake, because they’re such a bad vegetable, and no one I’ve ever spoken to likes them.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [enthusiastically] Hello my very good friends! This is Gig here at the new, big ship we all live in! We’re doing a tour of the big ship and talking to our friends that live inside of it. Uh… [chuckles] uh, first we’ve got- we’ve got Tender, Tender Sky! Hi!
 
ALI (as Tender): Hey! Hey, Gig.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] Hey!
 
ALI (as Tender): How are you?
 
KEITH (as Gig): Good, I’ve got some questions for you.
 
ALI (as Tender): Yeah, I’m excited.
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s your perfect weekend?
 
ALI (as Tender): [laughs] Um… you know… that’s an interesting question, I um… you know… you know I’m totally running The Steady. And um… it’s nice to have a busy weekend? Have people come in. To see other people enjoying their time off, is that weird? But it’s like, you know, we’re all relaxing together! Um… [laughs]
 
KEITH (as Gig): That’s not weird, that’s nice!
 
ALI (as Tender): Yeah, right? Yeah. [laughs]
 
KEITH (as Gig): [in the background] Yeah.
 
ALI (as Tender): Um, typically I’ll take Sunday night to myself. Um, but beyond that, you know, just kind of seeing everyone at rest and being at rest myself, helping people out, you know.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah. [ALI laughs] Echo, Echo Reverie, how’s it going?
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Uh, what? Oh.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk]  Hi!
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): You’re still filming everything, huh? Hey.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Filming- I’m still- yeah I never stop. I never stopped and also I never stop. [SYLVIA sighs] Can I ask you some questions about being on the ship and living on the ship? [crosstalk] Well not about, but around—
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): [crosstalk] I mean you’re going to anyway, so go ahead.
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s your perfect weekend?
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Wh- [laughs]
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s your ideal weekend?
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Okay! Not what I expected. I’ll- g- train- train- I do training a… not work, what’s not work… um… I like- you know I used to have a sh- I used to have my own ship, that was fun, and I’d go out on the weekends and just sorta… cruise a little. And that was fun. [chuckles] Just like, you know.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] Just cruise.
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): I like looking for things! Gig, you can’t just ambush people when they’re unpacking their clothing, it’s not fair.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [chuckling] Do you need 8 seconds to collect yourself?
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Minimum.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Okay. Signet, hi!
 
JANINE (as Signet): Hi Gig.
 
KEITH (as Gig): How, we haven’t talked much, can I ask you some questions?
 
JANINE (as Signet): I- you can always ask me questions Gig.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Oh great, I have twelve.
 
JANINE (as Signet): [crosstalk] Okay…
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] What’s your perfect weekend?
 
JANINE (as Signet): Um… I don’t really take weekends? So… I don’t know what answer to give you that would distinguish them from any other day.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Tender. [ALI laughs lightly in the background] Who’s someone you really admire?
 
ALI (as Tender): You know, this- this might be predictable, but I’ve really admired Cascara. I’ve enjoyed working for her, and um… you know, it’s been a good opportunity, and you know I’ve enjoyed all the time that I’ve spent with her.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Who’s someone you really admire?
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Oh, man, um… I mean, easy answer, my big brother. He- coolest guy in the world. 
30:00
Um… I hope you get to meet him sometime.
 
KEITH (as Gig): That would be nice!
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Yeah, I don’t know, who is someone you’d know, I mean. [sighs] He kinda reminds me of Even sometimes, so I guess maybe him.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Okay.
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): They both just like very good— they seem to know how to act under pressure, and that’s kinda what I’m trying to get good at? So yeah, that’s someone who I look up to.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Who’s someone you really admire?
 
JANINE (as Signet): Um… that’s a good question. And admittedly one I don’t think I think about often enough. I think at the moment, um… at the moment, I think I admire… Grand Magnificent. Um, I admire anyone who can, you know, who can find their way in one direction and then find their way back. I think that’s something that a lot of people don’t know if they’re capable of until they… until they’re put to it, and I think he’s, um… more admirable than I gave him credit for when we first met.
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s your best color?
 
ALI (as Tender): Oh my god Gig, that’s an amazing question.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Thank you.
 
ALI (as Tender): Um… yeah, so, I have purple hair, so I wear a lot of white cause I think it kind of like, plays into it? But like, makes the purple pop!
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah.
 
ALI (as Tender): But black also does that just as well, so you know, neutrals are great. Gold, oh my god. Gold is a neutral, I don’t know if you knew this. Um…
 
KEITH (as Gig): Of course I knew that gold is a neutral.
 
ALI (as Tender): [laughs] Of course you do, you look so good! Um… yeah, I would say black… black, white gold. [crosstalk] Top three.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] [unimpressed] Black, white, neutrals, gold, that’s your best color?
 
ALI (as Tender): Yeah! [KEITH chuckles] Well cause I make the rest of the world colorful, and then we- you know. You know Gig!
 
KEITH (as Gig): Oh I know. [ALI laughs] What’s your best color?
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Pink.
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s your best color?
 
JANINE (as Signet): You know I wear a lot of- a lot of black, I wear a lot of white, I wear a lot of gold. Uh… I like jeweled tones, I don’t wear them as much as I should, but they look great on everyone. [crosstalk] Something about jeweled tones.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] What’s the best jeweled tone?
 
JANINE (as Signet): Oh, shit. Um… [ALI snickers, KEITH and ANDREW start laughing] Emerald? [JANINE starts laughing too as everyone else continues]
 
KEITH (as Gig): [amused] No, that’s good. [laughing continues] Um, what goal do you have for the next year?
 
ALI (as Tender): You know I just wanna make this work! You know? Um… I… [chuckles] When we were with the Beloved I feel like, we were doing work that was similar but maybe… I don’t wanna say less important, but I think the ability to do the sort of work that helps people, but reach more people is a big deal! So, you know. Um, I’m just really excited to- to keep doing this and to meet you, Gig! And the rest of everyone else who’s new here, and kind of, you know really make a name for ourselves!
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s one goal you have for the next year?
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Oh man, um… I got a couple! One is to get my weird friend to stop filming me all the time.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] [chuckles] Get outta here.
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): [crosstalk] My other one is, I really just kinda want things— I’m hoping that we can make things quiet down a little? It’s been really tiring, and it’d be nice for some peace and quiet, you know?
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah. What’s one goal you have for the next year?
 
JANINE (as Signet): Uh… you know, I… I think um… my goal would be to help people reconnect? More uh… there’s a lot of things that I could do just doing what I was doing. Um.. but a lot of that happens in isolation, and this seems like a good opportunity to help mend some bridges.
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s your most prized possession?
 
ALI (as Tender): [laughs] Um.. when I was able to go back to… the By and By before it was evacuated and the whole deal, you know the whole deal.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [tiredly] I know the whole deal…
 
ALI (as Tender): I was able to visit um… like a locker that I had, whatever it’s not important, um… and I didn’t realize that I kept it there, but I guess it was the most convenient place that I would have access to. But I had like the um… [laughing] the paperwork that I filled out when I started working for the local Anticipation chapter? When I started? And then um… the necklace that I was given once I was like fully certified! And, you know leaving the By and By was hard initially. Um… but returning to that and, you know, having the stuff in this new chapter of my life is- is a nice reminder of like [mic noises] the journey I suppose.
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s your most prized possession?
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Oh, I mean, come on it’s the- I got a- It’s my sword. Look at that thing.
 
KEITH (as Gig): It’s cool.
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): It’s cool as hell!
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] It’s cool as hell.
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): [crosstalk] And like I mean, it’s an heirloom, my brother gave it to me. I don’t know. I’m really proud of it.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah. [pause] What’s your most prized possession?
 
JANINE (as Signet): Uh… I have a yellow dress I like a lot.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Hey Tender.
 
ALI (as Tender): Mm-hmm.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Who’s your favorite horse on the ship?
 
ALI (as Tender): [laughs] You know, I’ve been looking around for other horses, but I think Duck takes the cake.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Duck takes the cake, yeah. [ALI chuckles] Hey Echo!
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): [crosstalk] Yeah.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] Who’s your favorite horse on the ship?
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Oh you brought that? [AUSTIN chuckles] Duck, I guess.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [outraged] You guess! Uggggh.
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): It give- listen. It looks at me weird!
 
AUSTIN (as DUCK): [crosstalk] Echo.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] That’s just how it looks!
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): [disturbed] Oh, I don’t. Ohhh.
 
AUSTIN (as Duck): Echo.
 
KEITH (as Gig): He’s here! [crosstalk] Say hi!
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): [crosstalk] Okay, I’m sorry Duck!
 
AUSTIN (as Duck): [crosstalk] Duck.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] Hi five Duck! [AUSTIN makes Duck noises]
 
[two claps in sequence]
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): [distressed] Why were there t- Why did it make two noises?
 
KEITH (as Gig): It was a high five and then a low five.
 
AUSTIN (as Duck): Duck.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Hey Signet, who’s your favorite horse on the ship?
 
JANINE (as Signet): There’s a horse on the ship?
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s the most fun you’ve had this year?
 
ALI (as Tender): You know, this past year has been weird for me. I um… I’ve been working with the Cadent, as you know. Um… but I also was trying to take some time for myself? And… one time, while… you know just wandering around the planet that I was on, cause it was this new place that no one had ever known, I’d found like a um… like a little village! Out like on the seaside. And it was- it was so nice to kind of sit down with those people and talk to them and everything. And um…
 
ALI: [aside] Sorry my cat is like freaking out. [laughs]
 
KEITH (as Gig): There’s a cat on this ship? [ALI laughs]
 
ALI (as Tender): There just a- I’m sorry there’s like a… it’s like a digital- it’s like one of those pet things? Don’t worry about it. Um… [crosstalk] I just need to feed it.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] Oh, like a cat machine?
 
ALI (as Tender): Yeah, I just need to feed it at 5 and it’s like 5:10. Um, But no! yeah, I was hanging out with those people and it was great, and actually once we invited them back to um… Anticipation Falls! The Cadent has like a kind of formal sit-down dinner. But I was able to invite them and it was so much fun. It was really good!
 
[pause]
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s the most fun you had this year?
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Oh man, uh… oh! So I took a couple of- I was working on this outpost and I took a couple of people out into a nearby forest for like a little expedition thing? And… It was weirdly really fun? It was just kind of nice to get to know people that weren’t- you know involved in weird government schemes all the time? Uh… which is fine. I like you guys, don’t worry. I’m just saying, sometimes it’s cool to know a dude who just wants to make you really nice s’mores.
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s the most fun you had this year?
 
JANINE (as Signet): Gig I don’t think you should keep a horse on this ship. It’s… we don’t have- you sleep under the pool table, don’t you?
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah, but there’s- there’s bed. Gig- Duck.
 
JANINE (as Signet): Horses don’t sleep in [crosstalk] beds, Gig!
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] Duck sleeps in the bed I was assigned.
 
JANINE (as Signet): I have a friend who takes care of horses, if you want to make sure that [crosstalk] Duck’s in good hands.
 
KEITH (as Gig): This… isn’t a regular horse.
 
 
JANINE (as Signet): Okay. [crosstalk] I don’t know what that means.
 
AUSTIN (as Duck): [crosstalk] Hrmmm.
 
JANINE (as Signet): Does that mean they sleep on a bed?
 
AUSTIN (as Duck): [crosstalk] Regular.
 
KEITH (as Gig): No, [crosstalk] it means that they get smaller from front-to-back and they prehensile tentacles and they can talk a little bit.
 
AUSTIN (as Duck): Beautiful.
 
JANINE (as Signet): I don’t understand what that means, Gig.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah, Duck’s beautiful. Look at him- he’s right here!
 
JANINE (as Signet): Smaller from front to back?
 
KEITH (as Gig): The further down you go the smaller he gets.
 
AUSTIN (as Duck): Perspective.
 
JANINE (as Signet): Oh… [SYLVIA laughs]
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah, perspective. But it’s real though, look, turn to the side Duck.
 
JANINE (as Signet): Perspective is real too.
 
AUSTIN: Good.
 
JANINE (as Signet): Okay… why did it make a Transformers noise? [ALI and AUSTIN start laughing]
 
KEITH (as Gig): He’s like a… he’s like the penny-farthing bicycle of horses. Is that what those are called?
 
AUSTIN (as Duck): Nnn-yes.
 
JANINE (as Signet): I guess.
 
KEITH (as Gig): If you could have any food right now, what would it be?
 
ALI (as Tender): Honey butter oats.
 
KEITH (as Gig): What is that?
 
ALI (as Tender): It’s- [chuckles] okay, so you take like oatmeal, and then you like toast it a little bit? And then you melt butter and you mix it with honey and then you cover it in the oats? And then you wait until it’s like a little less sticky, and then you can eat it, with a spoon, and it’s really good. It’s like a cereal but it’s like super not gonna…
 
KEITH (as Gig): If you could have any food right now what would it be?
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Yeah, okay so it’s not quite food, but I think you’re like the only person here who gets this. Remember that jelly juice stuff?
 
KEITH (as Gig): Ohhh my god I remember that jelly juice. [crosstalk] That was so good!
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): [crosstalk] Incredible. Incredible!
 
KEITH (as Gig): I can have, and did have, like nine or ten, just bring eleven, twelve, thirt- I can just have them over and over, they’re good.
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Is one of those things- I can’t find anywhere that makes it? We should try and figure it out sometime.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah, we should brew a batch.
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Yeah.
 
KEITH (as Gig): If you could have any food right now, what would it be?
 
JANINE (as Signet): Uh… Does it have to be food, could it be a drink?
 
KEITH (as Gig): Uh, it can be a drink, Echo did a drink.
 
JANINE (as Signet): Okay, um… maybe some hot water, or like a little glass of wine would be nice.
 
KEITH (as Gig): A glass of lime what?
 
JANINE (as Signet): W-wine.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Oh wine, [AUSTIN laughs] okay that makes more sense. Hey Tender, do you wanna give a shout out to someone who had your back?
 
ALI (as Tender): Yeah! Absolutely. Um… I, you know we’re working into the team now, but… I’ll never forget, you know, the time I spent with Fourteen and Signet. [crosstalk] That’s two people I know.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] So double, you’re gonna do a double. That’s fine [crosstalk] you can do a double.
 
ALI (as Tender): I know, but you know, we were a trio—
 
KEITH (as Gig): [in the background] Yeah.
 
ALI (as Tender): — and it was nice, and it’s good to be working with them again.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Mm-hmm. Echo, do you wanna give a shout out to someone who had your back?
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): [sighs] Uh… yeah, um… shout out to Serge. Keep doing [crosstalk] what you’re doing.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] Shout out to Serge! Keep doing it!
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Yep.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Keep fixing those cars, big cars!
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Gig, I don’t know how this works.
 
KEITH (as Gig): It works like this!
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Okay.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Hey Signet, do you wanna give a shout out to someone who’s had your back?
 
JANINE (as Signet): Um… yeah, you know. I haven’t really properly thanked her. I think Tender’s really had my back a lot in the past, and I’m… you know. It’s been a year, but I’m looking forward to working with her again, cause I know she will in the future.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Do you prefer falling asleep or waking up? Tender.
 
ALI (as Tender): I know. [ALI starts laughing.]
 
KEITH (as Gig): Oh it’s just a really tough question? Okay.
 
ALI (as Tender): [still laughing] It is a tough question, I’m sorry! Um… why is this one impossible? No, stop it, I’m sorry. [laughs again]
 
KEITH: That can all go in, that’s good. [ALI laughs]
 
ALI (as Tender): You, I prefer waking up. It’s tough, you know I like to party, so sometimes I fall asleep and I’m like “hell yeah it’s my bed.” But the experience of waking up and really… not knowing what the day is gonna have and being able to experience it is something that’s so joyful that I don’t think that people appreciate enough. So that’s my answer.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Do you prefer falling asleep or waking up?
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): Uh… I guess waking up? I feel like, falling asleep is nice and everything but you can’t really- fundamentally you can’t get anything done when you’re asleep.
 
KEITH (as Gig): Oh boy… Do you like falling asleep or waking up?
 
JANINE (as Signet): Um… I think… that’s a difficult question. I’m gonna say that I would… I would rather fall asleep with someone but wake up without someone.
 
KEITH (as Gig): After this, what’s your next job going to be?
 
ALI (as Tender): [laughs] Um… I already have like three jobs, Gig! So probably one of those. I don’t know, probably keeping the Steady running. I think if I was gonna retire, that’s the only thing. I would get a real building! And live out the rest of my life just doing it.
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s your next job going to be?
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): [laughs] Oh, you’re serious. Um…
 
KEITH (as Gig): Yeah, after we do this, what’s your next thing?
 
SYLVIA (as Echo): N-n-none. No. I’m not doing a j- I’m done after this. I’m retiring early.
 
KEITH (as Gig): What’s your next job going to be?
 
JANINE (as Signet): Um… women’s only theater troupe. No, I’m going to be doing the same thing I’ve been doing for 300 years probably. [snorting noise]
 
KEITH (as Gig): Alright, well that wraps it up. That’s your tour of… what’s the name of this ship? [Sylvia chuckles]
 
ALI (as Tender): [crosstalk] The World Without End.
 
KEITH (as Gig): [crosstalk] Tender, what’s the name of this ship? [ALI laughs] [yelling from afar] Hey Tender! What’s the name of this ship?
 
ALI (as Tender): [fake yelling] It’s the World Without End, Gig!
 
KEITH (as Gig): That’s it for the tour of the World Without End, the new, big ship we all live on.
