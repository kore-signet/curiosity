Announcing: PARTIZAN (And Some New Merch!)
Transcriber: Cole

Austin: Hey, everybody. It’s Austin here with a few announcements. Um, most of these I think I’ve made already either in the Spring in Hieron post-mortem at the very, very, very end or in the Drawing Maps update that went up last week over on the Patreon. But some people aren’t patrons, and also, some people maybe didn’t listen to a four hour long episode or heard the announcements at the very end. And so, for your convenience, I wanted to quickly hope on a microphone and get everyone caught up with what the plan is going forward and then also shout-out a few cool things that we’ve got goin’ on right now. 

So, first up, I just want to talk about some- some merch that we announced at the end of the Spring in Hieron post-mortem. We have two really, really cool things up right now, and both of them are in pre-order stages. And I think for one of them, that pre-order closes on the first. On Oct- October first. And so I wanted to get out as quickly as possible and let y’all know, ‘Hey. You can still get this.’ But… those two things- One are prints of all of the Hieron- all of the Hieron cover art. Not just the Spring in Hieron cover art, but the… Autumn in Hieron, the- the Winter/Marielda cover art, and then also the Spring in Hieron cover art. That is available at friendsatthetable.shop. One more time, that’s friendsatthetable.shop. They’re twelve by twelve. They have the art that’s done by Craig Sheldon, who you can follow on Twitter @shoddyrobot. There- It’s just cool to see… the- the art as like, a print that we can hang up. They are really cool, and honestly, there’s a really good deal on getting the full three-part set. They’re fifteen dollars a pop, but you can get all three of them for thirty-five, which is like, a ten dollar discount. Um, so you can check those out again at friendsatthetable.shop.

We are also working with heartofthedeernicorn.com. Uh, Heart of the Deernicorn is the name of the tabletop… publisher? I guess publisher, that makes Fall of Magic and BFF. Two games that we loved and that we’ve played. And we’re also working with Simon Sweetman, who is a fantastic artist whose done incredible Friends at the Table fanart. And in fact, this T-shirt/poster/hoodie that’s available at heartofthedeernicorn.com is… taking some of Simon’s- taking a piece of Simon’s fanart for our Fall of Magic game, updating it by adding additional characters to it. Uh, Simon did an incredible job doing that. And- and now turning it into merch. So, that is available also at heartofthedeernicorn.com. Shout-outs to Ross Cowman for- for making that happen and for Simon- to Simon for doing the art. That’s two pieces of merch. 

 Third merch adjacent thing, and I’m gonna call this merch.You can pick up a lot of- and maybe haven’t heard these actually, now that I think about it- Have you heard any of these yet? I don’t think if you’re only on the main feed you would have heard… any of these. But for those of you who have listened to the Patreon Live at the Table shows, there have been a couple of Live at the Tables that have had special music done by Jack de Quidt, and Jack has put that music up over on their bandcamp. That is at notquite.bandcamp.com.That also has new cover art that is fantastic, also by Craig Sheldon. And so that is the- Oh, you know what? You would have heard the Fall of Magic- the Fall of Magic theme. If you’ve listened to the Fall of Magic game, that is available now. The Lasers and Feelings track that Jack made a few years ago is up there. And then the two Clapcast stings, the Spring in Hieron and Twilight Mirage ones, are also available up there for pay-what-you-want. So- so check those out. Notquitereal.bandcom- .bandcamp.com.

Four- fourth announcement. Again, if you’re listening to this and you’ve- you probably are a patron, you’ve probably already heard this. I guess there’s a chance you’re a patron, but you don’t listen to Drawing Maps because you want to go into a new season completely fresh, you want nothing that’s even close to a spoiler, um, but heads up. We actually made one change to our Patreon. I guess kind of two, in a sense… I guess three, in a sense. [lightly laughs] Two things happen at once. Um, [laughs] previously we had a twenty-thousand dollar a month goal and a thirty-thousand dollar a month goal, and we sort of flipped them. Previously our thirty-thousand dollar a month goal was the commitment to doing a Friends at the Table live show as a stand alone show, not as part of a big hundred dollar plus ticketed convention. 

A stand alone show somewhere that makes sense for us to do it. We’ll have to look into where that is. My guess is it’s probably a coastal in North America because flights to those places tend to be fairly easy cause they’re hub cities. But we don’t know yet. We’re gonna look around at all of our options. We’re gonna, you know, figure out where, you know- what makes the most sense for- for the cast, and- and for the audience, and make a decision based on that. That is the twenty-thousand dollar goal. And we are currently over twenty-thousand dollars, so we are committing to make that happen this year, so long as we stay over twenty-thousand dollars.

Uh, our thirty-thousand goal is a new thing. It used to be that- There used to be a goal that was if we hit a certain point, we would do an extra episode of Bluff City. Which, by the way, new Bluff City coming soon because we recorded a full game. We’re getting ready to do another one, so if you're waiting for Bluff City, Bluff City is on its way. Um, we’re gonna do another new show if we hit thirty-thousand dollars, and that show is called Random Article. It is a show where we… open up wikipedia and hit random and talk about what we hit for an hour comedically. If you like the diversions that we go on sometimes in conversations, if- when we google animals or when we bring up weird historical facts, this is a thing you might like a lot. And you can hear a test of it by going to our Patreon and then clicking on Pusher under the list of tags, which is kind of on the left side of the Patreon page. Again, the Patreon is friendsatthetable.cash, and if you scroll down, you will see that there has been made open a- an update called… Pusher Update: New Bonus Show Pilot that was from May. And it is an hour long conversation between Jack, Art, Dre, and I as we look up… things about cricket and… uh, Paul Bunyan. It’s- it’s really good. And I hope you enjoy it. 

Real quick, just to give a little bit of insight into what went into that decision. We really wanted to do a show- We- we would love to do an extra Bluff City episode a month, but it’s just not feasible with how busy all of our schedules are. For- on my side, in terms of prep. On Ali’s side, in terms of production. Honestly, in terms of everyone’s available time to- to do the work of like, prepping for real game is actually like- it takes a little bit to do- to do what we do. And it is one of those things where it’s like, we know we want to keep giving people cool stuff. How do we something that’s like- has our voice and has our feel, but doesn’t necessarily require all of us to do another big lift. Because we just can’t right now. You know, we’re not at the point where being- where we’re all able to like, quit our jobs and make this our full time thing, unfortunately. And so- and so we thought this up because it’s the sort of thing that we already do in the show and that we love to do. It’s like, why not just try it and see how it goes. So again, that’s our thirty-thousand dollar stretch goal now. Who knows if we hit that ever. I would be so incredibly honored if we ever did, but it’s a cool thing, and it’s free. The one that we did is free if you go to the Patreon page to check out. So that’s- so that’s there. 

The other thing that I want to shout-out briefly on the Patreon right now is that we are- I’m kind of testing something out for a feature that we did- that I’ve been doing called Drawing Maps. Drawing Maps is a special show that I do where I um… I basically show you some- some… background into what my prep looks like. These started as streams where I would literally just hop on a youtube stream, open to patrons, and would kind of uh, be like, ‘Hey. Here- This is- this is it. This is what this looks like. Um, this is how I figure out a new faction. Here is how I’m prepping a location for the next session, et cetera.’ The thing is that with my schedule right now, a lot of the prep I do, I do on like, the subway on my phone or at 3 a.m. when I can’t sleep. And so, it turns out the easiest way for me to actually produce some of that stuff and show you that- that little behind the scenes is to write it up a little bit. 

Here’s like a- here’s a post from- or I can just explain what the one is I’m doing now, I guess. Which is for the next season that we’re gonna do, which I’ll talk about in a second. I should have flopped these two things in order. We’re playing Beam Saber, a game by Austin Ramsay. You can- you can find that by doing- by going to itch.io and searching for Beam Saber. Or I guess google, if you search for Beam Saber Austin Ramsay. R-A-M-S-A-Y. You will find Beam Saber. It’s a Forged in the Dark mech game. It’s a return for us to the world we started building in COUNTERWeight and Twilight Mirage set five thousand years or so after Twilight Mirage. Um, and for me, at the point we are now in pre-production… we’re not- we haven’t started recording the main show yet, I am building factions. And so, I walk you through in the Draw- the new Drawing Maps updates, which are available for anyone at the five dollar tier or more, what it means to create a faction. I’ve kind of broken each episode down because it’s a- it’s a text update plus like, you know… the first two have been pretty long. They’ve both been about like, fifty minutes to an hour, but in the future, I think they’ll drop down to twenty to thirty minutes. I- I hope. We’ll see. Um, of me explaining what goes into those things. 

So, for instance, in the first one, I talked about how using the Beam Saber system, I decided what one of the factions- or what kind of all of the factions governmental types were. In the next one, I talked about this big break through that I had with regards to understanding and building aesthetics that are tied to each of the- each of the games’ five major factions. And if you want to like, get a peek into my brain and like, the way I very nonlinearly like, jump between different processes and like, try to put together a throughline so that there’s consistency and kind of an aesthetic foundation, or an aesthetic palette from which I can draw on- or not even just an aesthetic one, a mechanic one- a kind of palette of possibility that I’m able to pull from during sessions. I think those updates are really cool. They’re- they're not very spoilery, at least the ones that are- that I’m working on now are not. I always do my best to signal spoilers. And so, that is a fun thing, and I- I hope worth the five bucks. If you’ve listened to those, and you haven’t yet, I’d love it if you go to the comments in the Patreon and say if you like it or if you don’t. If you miss the streams. If you would rather the streams. If you would rather more updates like this. The text and audio stuff. Et cetera. 

Which leads to the last of these announcements which is that starting next Thursday, in this feed, the Road to Season Six will begin. If you’ve been a patron, you probably already know what that is. If you haven’t been, if maybe you just listen to the podcast, you don’t follow us on Twitter or anywhere else, uh, maybe I haven’t mentioned it, or maybe you’re not caught up on Hieron necessarily where I’ve mentioned it in some of the intros. The Road to Season Six is an anthology series that connects Twilight Mirage, the end of Twilight Mirage to the beginning of what our next season is. That next season is called Partizan. P-A-R-T-I-Z-A-N. Again, we’re playing Beam Saber next season. And this gonna be a collection of games that- that- uh, a collection of episodes rather that tells the story through vignettes, through one-shots, not through a single cohesive, you know, narrative. It’s not Marielda, right? Like, it’s not like, ‘Here are our- here are some characters that connect these two things.’ It is this kind of wide-angle view that include some incredible games. 

Ranging from stuff that we have… wanted to play for a while. Dialect is the first game that we kicked things off with to games made by folks in the larger Friends at the Table community. We have Briar Sovereign’s Armour Astir. We have Austin Ramsay’s um… Beam Saber. We test out both of those. And then also, from dusk to midnight by Riley Rethal, which is also very cool and includes the- We do a game that’s the dusk to midnight, and then we use those- that same set of characters in our Beam Saber game. And those are some of my favorite characters that some of my players have ever- have ever created. And we kind of just take snapshots of this five thousand year period that traces a couple of factions and their growing empire. Because that is what this next season- what Partizan is going to be about, at least partially. It’s actual play. Who knows where this takes us? 

But going into it, the big questions that I have in my mind are about empire and imperialism and complicity and complicated characters who, you know, you come to love, but who are also caught up in something disastrous. Um, it is going to be the first season we’ve done that is explicitly about war and explicitly about giant robots. Not just gonna have giant robots there. [lightly laughs] Um, I’ve loved doing the Road to Season Six stuff. We are doing our best to edit it down. Some of those games go very long, and so I’m like halfway through editing the first of those games right now. We suspect the Road to Season Six is going to last until… I would say December? Early December? And that is when Partizan itself will kick off. Love to start a season with a- with a holiday special. Whoops. Uh, and we’ll see how that goes. 

I guess, the last thing here is if you haven’t yet heard the uh, trailer for the Road to Season Six, which is- features a new track by Jack, which will go in that Live at the Table um… album on- on bandcamp- on their bandcamp once these episodes start hitting the main feed and also features quotes from the Road to Season Six games, well then I’ll- I’ll play it for you. Just in case you haven’t heard it yet or if you want to listen to it again the way I like to because of how good it is and how much I love all of my players and the things that they say. And because of how much I love Jack and their music. I’m gonna put it right now where it will- it will take me out. I don’t have to say anymore words. I will let this trailer for the Road to Season Six speak for me. Peace. 

[Jack de Quidt’s “HOURGLASS. SUNRISE. CRYSTALLINE.” plays as trailer begins] 

Austin: What might a just history look like? On the barren moon of Partizan it might look like frozen time. Today it drifts in placid loops. Third satellite of its system's largest world. But by the year of fourteen twenty three of the Divine Principality’s perfect to millennium, when it is at the crossroads of a fractious empire, war will shake its orbit. 

Dre (as Vessel’s Gold in Armour Astir): These divines basically wrecked my people. So, even though I’ve fought pretty much anything, when I saw you in the sky, I went cold. 

Keith (as Pique Nideo in Microscope): We would like for it to be dedicated to Stel Nideo. A grand gesture for a grand house. 

Jack (as Marianne Perfect in Ech0): In order to attune artillery unit sensors better, we are not told anything about our bodies before we inhabit them. We enter our mechs in darkness, and we leave them in darkness. 

Ali (as Pidgeon in Beam Saber): No one needs to get hurt here, but I didn't need you to shut down the power to this facility immediately. 

Art (as Memphis Longhand in Beam Saber): The only god Memphis Longhand has ever seen in a mech is in Memphis Longhand’s onboard mirror. 

Janine: Anyway, the thing I wanted to do was to mess with someone's blood. 

Sylvia (as Orbit Shard in For the Queen): If my Apokine decides to give me something and tells me to keep it close, I will keep it close to me. Whether it's a weapon or not. 

Jack: Hey, Austin? 

Austin: Yeah. 

Jack: You wanna know what the weak point of a mech is? 

Austin: Yeah, what's the weak point of a mech? 

JACK: The fuckin’ pilot. 

[Music fades]
