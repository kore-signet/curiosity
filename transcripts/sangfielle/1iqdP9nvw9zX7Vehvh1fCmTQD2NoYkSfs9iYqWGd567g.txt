Sangfielle 41: Just Returns Pt. 5
Transcriber: robotchangeling

Austin: Sangfielle is a series that draws on elements of dark fantasy, horror, and gothic fiction. As such, a list of content warnings will always be made available in the episode description.

Austin (as Bucho): Without their sniper, should be easy enough to approach. The question is where we strike, hmm?

Art (as Duvall): Well, we could…we could signal the Red Zephyr. 

Ali (as Marn): And then what?

Art (as Duvall): Then we have a…a train. 

Jack: I mean…

Art (as Duvall): Our train.

Austin: Bucho and Alekest are both looking at you now with wider and wider eyes.

[Music begins: “Sangfielle” by Jack de Quidt]

Austin: You're going through these houses, and you hear the sound of a calf crying. It's leashed, and it's being kind of walked around. And the thing you realize is like, they're walking this calf back and forth. You watch them do this path three or four times, and at first, you're like, why are they frowning? And you realize they aren't frowning. It's that their smile is melting into a frown, because their face is made of wax. [Jack sighs in dismay] Scattered throughout Blackwick are members of Alaway’s legion of waxen followers. 


Ali (as Marn): We don't know where Polyte is, but we don't want them to keep doing this. So if they meet us at the train station, whatever happens happens. And tell them you don't trust me. That's fine. But just say that I came here and I threatened you and that's where we're gonna be tonight.

Austin (as Kerr): All right, I'll do it. I don't like this either.


Janine: What does it take to get them to leave if we don't know where the person they want is?

Austin (as Ennib): We're here for Polyte, and if we can't get Polyte, we’ll take you. And beyond that, I don't know. You'd have to break spirits.

Art (as Duvall): You did a really bad job taking us.

Austin (as Ennib): It's not over yet, is it?

Art (as Duvall): It might be for you.

Janine (as Es): Okay, well, we—

Austin: She looks you in the eyes and says—

Janine (as Es): We don’t need to salt the wounds. 

Austin: And she says:

Austin (as Ennib): I'm still breathing. You won't be.


Austin: You note that gold tooth that was glinting, it falls from his mouth as if it couldn't stay stuck in the wax, and it just goes like tink, tink, tink and falls out onto the floor in front of you. And he and his whole body begin to rumble and bubble and boil and pour out of the small holes in the plate armor. In this moment, pouring into the train station, as if like it was as tightly packed as it could be. Like, you know, you hold in your breath when you put on pants that are a little too tight for you, and then has been holding it for god knows how long. God knows how long the real Gren Voznik was killed and replaced by this beast.

[song ends]

Austin: Welcome to Friends at the Table, an actual play podcast focused on critical world building, smart characterization, and fun interaction between good friends. I'm your host, Austin Walker. And joining me today, Ali Acampora.

Ali: Hi! You can find me over at @ali_west on twitter.com.

Austin: Janine Hawkins.

Janine: Hi, you can find me at @bleatingheart on twitter.com.

Austin: Jack de Quidt.

Jack: Hi. You can find me on Twitter at @notquitereal and buy any of the music featured on the show at notquitereal.bandcamp.com.

Austin: And Art Martinez-Tebbel. 

Art: Hey, you can find me on twitter.com at @atebbel. I'm locked up right now. If you hear this and that's still true, it's not— nothing's happening. If you just request, and I’ll approve it. But also like, maybe take that as a sign that none of us should be on twitter.com.

Jack: Mm.

Ali: Yeah.

Austin: Yeah, I'm basically not there anymore. 

Ali: Yeah.

Art: Yeah, it sucks.

Austin: I’m like sort of there. I respond to stuff. But yeah, it's way worse than…than good. It's bad. [Ali laughs] 

Art: It's way worse than good is a great slogan for Twitter. [Janine laughs] 

Ali: It is worse than good.

Austin: Yeah, it's way worse than good. [Austin, Ali, and Jack laugh] 

Art: Way worse than good. 

Austin: As always, you can follow us on Twitter at @friends_table [Art laughs] or support the show by going to friendsatthetable.cash where you'll find behind the scenes stuff and live games and an upcoming Bluff City arc that is extremely fun that we’ve had in the can for a little bit but is, I think, perfectly timed to warm your winter bones.

Ali: Mm-hmm.

Austin: [laughs softly] Oh, that one's a good one.

Ali: Yeah, that's gonna be a great January/February companion for y'all.

Austin: Yeah, I think so. I think so.

Janine: Bone warmer. Please. 

Austin: Yeah. Huh? 

Janine: Bone warmer, please.

Austin: No.

Ali: Uh huh.

Art: Bone warmer please.

Janine: [laughs softly] No, I was saying you should call it a bone warmer.

Austin: I don't want to.

Janine: A great January/February bone warmer. [laughs] 

Austin: A bone warmer.

Janine: Anyway.

Austin: Yeah.

Art: Warm your bones.

Ali: [quietly] Is that a callback? What are you talking about? [laughs] 

Austin: I think I just made some sort of bone warmer joke, but I am too… [Ali laughs] I’m like frankly a little dazed.

Janine: You said to warm your winter bones!

Austin: Ohh.

Ali: Ah.

Austin: I did say that, didn’t I?

Janine: You did! [laughs] 

Austin: Yeah.

Janine: A second ago, literally.

Austin: This show is like, I am in a fevered haze while I record this show. You can't hold me accountable for anything I do or say. 

Janine: Mm-hmm. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Like, last time we recorded, I found that voice for Rebek, Rebek Semm, and I was like, this character’s here. I didn’t practice this voice.

Ali: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah! When you became a justified villain. That was amazing.

Austin: I became a justified villain for like a sec—

Art: Yeah. 

Austin: I don't know that I'll get it back today.

Jack: Yeah, she’s great. 

Austin: I don't know. I didn’t go back and listen.

Ali: Oh, I— it's in there. I believe that it's in there. [laughs] 

Austin: [doubtful] Mm. I believe it was in there a week ago.

Art: If it doesn’t work out, we’ll just…we’ll go to Walton Goggins and be like… [Austin and Ali laugh] 

Austin: We gotta fit you in. 

Art: “Hey, do you want to do a very quick guest appearance in this podcast?”

Austin: Yeah, uh huh. Yeah.

Jack: Play a goat woman?

Austin: Yeah, do you want to— [laughs] please, thank you. Um, speaking of—

Art: This is— your show got canceled. 

Austin: Uh huh.

Art: This is a day's work. 

Austin: Yeah. I'll have all the dialogue pre-recorded in my regular voice. You just have to redub it. 

Jack: Wait, also. 

Austin: Uh huh?

Jack: Just really quick, is Ezek and Rebek Ezekiel and Rebeka?

Austin: I've explicitly said they're not. 

Jack: Oh. [laughs] I didn’t— 

Austin: But are they ?

Jack: I must have missed that.

Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. When I first introduced Ezek, I'm like—

Jack: Oh, yeah, you said that Ezekiel…

Austin: “Which you might think is short for Ezekiel, but it absolutely isn't,” and I think I said the same thing for Rebek. 

Jack: Oh, great.

Austin: But yeah, sure, right. That's what I'm evoking, right?

Jack: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Austin: Also, another thing to clarify. I keep talking about the person that, um…we should do a summary. Let's do a quick summary. 

Ali: Mm-hmm.

Austin: And I'll introduce the thing I want to clarify in the middle of the summary. What happened last time?

Ali: [deep breath] Hi. So, um…

Austin: Hi. 

Ali: [laughs] After learning that Blackwick is under siege by the Magistrates, and Pickman and Marn got shot trying to look—

Art:  Mm.

Austin: [laughs softly] That's true. That did happen.

Ali: The group— [laughs] the group—

Jack: Immediately. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Ali: The group put a plan together and moved to the Weather Room—

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Ali: —previously like a high point above Blackwick, where you can look down. Es, uh, jumped up and ki— [laughs] 

Austin: Oh, right.

Ali: Knocked out the sniper of the Magistrates.

Austin: Yeah, that’s true. 

Ali: Tied her up, had a cool grappling hook situation. [laughs] 

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Ali: Then everybody else went down the mountain, now that it was more safe. Es and Duvall went to talk to the sniper who was tied up, to be like, “Help us out, what's your deal, yada yada.” 

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Ali: [laughs] Pickmarn went with the other two Shape Knights, Bucho and Ale…I should know this person's name. Alekest.

Austin: Alekest.

Ali: [laughs] To follow the priest, who was doing some sort of priest prayer [laughs] train magic situation.

Austin: Uh huh, yeah.

Ali: Making the train not come through. Broke that spell, question mark? Broke that spell?

Austin: I believe so. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Ali: Yeah.

Austin: I believe Pickman and Alekest— they studied it, and I think we hand— we didn’t hand-wave it.

Jack: Yeah.

Austin: We said— I said like studying it is the thing that's where you need to make a roll, not doing it.

Ali: Uh huh.

Austin: Doing it is pretty simple once you know what to do.

Ali: And then Marn met up with the other Telluricist who's in town.

Austin: Right, right. 

Ali: And was like, “Yo, tell the Magistrates to meet us at the train station.” And then also saw that like people in Blackwick are like wax people now, which is very bad and not good.

Austin: It’s pretty bad. Pretty not good, at the very least.

Ali: [laughs] So we go to the train station. The rendezvous is happening. We've broken the spell. We think that this is gonna go well. A cool justified character shows up, which is the sister of the person that we killed in the first arc, the Magistrate who they're all mad about.

Austin: [crosstalk] Yep. Yep. Mm-hmm. 

Ali: [laughs] By the way, they’re—

Austin: Also they— go ahead.

Ali: They're also looking for Polyte, who was the person—

Austin: That’s, yes.

Ali: —the other person that we were…that was “saving,” quote unquote, in that arc.

Austin: Which, which this is the point of clarification I want to make is I keep talking about the person that Polyte killed as being a pope, but that is not true. I'm using that as shorthand for like a religious leader. And I don't think that you even know it in the fiction of the world, right?

Ali: Mm-hmm.

Austin: I think maybe you— you may have asked at one point, like, “Okay, what’d you really do?” And I want to say Polyte was like, “Do you even know who this person is?” you know? [Ali laughs] But maybe I’m…

Jack: It's like, that's Concentus bullshit, right? That's stuff for them to worry about. We're in Sangfielle.

Austin: Uh, it's north of Contentus bullshit. It's…it's your hometown.

Jack: Oh, right, up in the Magistratum.

Austin: It’s the Magistratum bullshit. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I should just say briefly, because I— it's worth just saying this, because I think what the kind of the Fulmina, you know, believers, how their organization is set up is kind of fun. Which is just in the sense that this is a goddess about instant justice, she's also a goddess about like instant revelation. And so it's like a prophet-organized culture, where like people make claim that they have had grand and immediate revelations. 

[0:10:17]

Jack: Huh.

Austin: And the people who can do that more often are the people who wind up in charge of kind of regional, big regional churches. There is no single, you know, leader. There is no like patriarchal or…there's no like that style of like, here is the pontiff, here is the head of the church. They all believe in variations on central beliefs that you can point to, prophets who’ve had their prophecies come true, and like that means the rest of what they say tends to be kind of softly canonized. All of this is just like excess worldbuilding stuff that just was never gonna make its way into the game because it’s just not a focal point. But I did want to clarify that before 80 people told me I just made the Catholic Church again on Twitter, because that's what’s gonna happen. [Ali laughs] 

Jack: Okay, yeah. 

Austin: Because I do have all these other ideas about this thing, and it’s just like, it's just not gonna come up. But that is their situation. So, they— so, Polyte killed a particularly beloved, or maybe a particularly powerful, let's say, one of these prophets, who had a pretty well established kind of sect of the core faith, so. A big kill, not a particularly good one. You'd have to ask Polyte what that was all about. Who knows if he would even say what it's actually about, so.

Ali: Mm-hmm. He was pretty cagey when we met him. Anyway, so we're in the— we're in the train station. We're with the Magistrates.

Austin: Yes.

Ali: And the Telluricist is there too but kind of hiding-

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Ali: —'cause she's like not with them, but she's with them, ‘cause they killed all those people and she’s like still chilling, so that's her problem. Anyway. So. [laughs] There's a standoff. Es and Pickman, question mark, and Duvall are hiding still? 

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Art: Uh huh. Yeah.

Ali: And then one, the guy with the ax. Was it the guy with the ax?

Austin: Guy with the ax. It was, the guy with the ax. Gren, Gren Voznik. 

Ali: Uh huh.

Austin: The Silent Hatchet, [Ali laughs] who was already not a big talker, obviously. That's part of how this scam worked.

Ali: Well, that was a weird thing, ‘cause it was also like that person was the person who was like interrogating people the first time we saw all of them, and now there's been like this big change. 

Austin: Mm-hmm. 

Ali: Anyway. Gold tooth falls out. Person transforms into a big wax figure. 

Austin: Mm-hmm. 

Ali: Growing, growing, growing. 

Austin: Bigger than even the bigger— bigger than even the biggest of the—

Ali: Yeah.

Austin: —combined goat wax people when you were down in Yellowfield, right? 

Ali: Mm-hmm.

Austin: I did say that? Okay.

Ali: Mm-hmm. And we find our heroes again. [laughs] 

Austin: Here we go. [Jack laughs] In this moment.

Ali: Uh huh. 

Austin: What do you do? This thing is just monstrous. Like, I just, it's…the…and I want to say the thing that's most monstrous about it is its inability or indifference to form. This is a creature that has no…like, I really want to communicate the idea that like, it was miserable being stuck in that human form for as long as it was. And being stuck in the armor, right? Being like caught in this platemail, being as condensed as it was. And so here there is a degree of like, rolling, constant changing form. It is not just a big tall guy, you know? Sometimes there is a…sometimes there's a pair of legs. Sometimes there's like multiple things that I guess you would call legs. Other times, it's just like a mass of wax flesh. And I will say—and here's a detail that I didn't give last time—where once there was clearly a face, the sort of thing that a tooth could fall out of, now faces appear and disappear in the flesh over and over again. Like, as if pushing up through the wax. And those of you who went to Yellowfield recognize them immediately as the other members of the Yellowfield Candle Company, the other people who worked there, including Gala who was the young woman who, you know, asked you to go find her mother, and then eventually whose body became the new Alaway’s new body, and including the Alaway body that you'd seen previously, or the face that you've seen previously, along with all the different workers, and it's like they're all in there. You're not sure what that means, you know, like metaphysically about what this thing is versus what— where Alaway is versus everything else. So. So yeah, big, big wax flesh monster, continuing to grow, head bumping up against the glass roof of this train station. The Magistrates believe you have done something here. I think it becomes very quick that there is a— you know, I think maybe the priest, she yells something like, you know, you know…

Austin (as Lejune): It's just as they say. You wield curses like the honorable do weapons. 

Austin: And produces one of these like prayer cards that we've seen her with and kind of tries to back away into a corner, and you have no idea what she's gonna do with that prayer card.

Jack: Accusing Marn Ancura of using curses. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Oh yeah, a hundred percent. A hundred percent.

Ali: That's really funny. I…that's especially funny, ‘cause at the end of last session, I was like, [optimistic] “We're gonna help them take down this wax guy who killed their boy, and then everything's gonna be good.” [laughs] 

Austin: Uh huh.

Ali: “It’s gonna be all under the bridge.” [laughs] 

Jack: And she immediately…

Austin: We'll see how it goes, right?

Ali: Yeah. Well, you know, we'll see. Um…yeah, it's tough to say, like, how do you react in this moment? Like, you are fearful and you jump out of the way, probably. I think Marn has the…Marn is standing in between two Shape Knights, which is great. 

Austin: Yes. Yeah. 

Ali: So I think Marn like takes a few steps back.

Austin: Uh huh.

Ali: [laughs] ‘Cause it’s just why you would have two people in armor next to you in this situation.

Austin: Mm-hmm. I think seeing you step back, Bucho lifts up Ennib, who's the sniper, by like the collar, and begins to like walk back with you and is like: 

Austin (as Bucho): We need to make distance. 

Austin: And like nods back to some sort of rear entrance or rear exit to the building, maybe. Those of you in hiding, what are you doing? Can we just get a snapshot of everyone looking at this thing and what your response is?

Art: I think it's, you know, Duvall like very frozen in like, [confused] “So, are we still doing the ambush part of this?” [Jack and Ali laugh] So like looking and seeing if someone else is gonna like jump out. 

Austin: Uh huh.

Art: Or if everyone's just gonna run. But in a predisposed to running posture, you know?

Ali: Mm, mm-hmm. 

Art: It’s…

Austin: Uh huh. 

Art: It looks like the party's over.

Austin: Mm-hmm. 

Jack: Are we… [sighs] So, we're in the train station, right? Which presumably backs onto the tracks running out of Blackwick?

Austin: Yep. I imagine they run up alongside it.

Jack: Yeah. How defensible— [laughs] is this a— yeah. What's our nearest best defensible position?

Austin: I don't know. I've never fought a big wax creature.

Jack: No, that might be everywhere else in the…in the city. 

Austin: Uh huh.

Jack: Ah, yikes. Um…

Austin: Which I suspect your characters don't quite know yet, right? That was a—

Jack: No, no, no.

Austin: The camera sees it happening, but the breadth of this horror has probably not hit you quite yet. 

Jack: Marn—

Austin: Though maybe you do start to hear, from outside, yells and the sound of gunfire going off or the sound of, you know, screaming.

Jack: Have you— you will have told us about your adventures in Yellowfield, right, Marn?

Ali: Oh, for sure. 

Jack: Yeah. 

Ali: Also, like, Bucho was there. 

Austin: Yes, Bucho was there.

Ali: And was turned into one of these people, so like…

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Jack: Yeah.

Ali: I don't know how much he'd be talking about that situation, but like…

Janine: Wasn’t— am I wrong, or wasn't Pickman also there?

Jack: No, I was in, um…

Austin: Bell Metal.

Janine: Okay, okay.

Jack: Yeah, I was having my own fun in Bell Metal.

Austin: Yeah. 

Ali: Yeah, that was us and Virtue and…

Janine: Right.

Austin: Chine.

Jack: Chine.

Austin: And Chine was there. Yeah.

Janine: Right. Okay, okay.

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Jack: Um…yeah, I think Pickman’s, you know, eyes widen fractionally on seeing this thing pour out of, uh…Grelt?

Austin: Grelt’s very good, but it's not Grelt. [Ali laughs softly] It’s Gren. Gren Voznik. RIP.

Jack: Gren.

Art: Was Grelt there? Is…

Austin: [laughs softly] Yes.

Jack: Was Grelt there? 

Austin: Was Grelt there. We did the “Was Grent there?” joke in the chat last time, so. 

Art: I did it, too. So I’m— what I’m telling you is— [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Wow. 

Art: —is I am a hack.

Jack: [laughs] I’m just gonna scroll up. 

Austin: You really wanted to go back for the…yeah, incredible.

Jack: Yeah, Art MT: “Was the Grent there?” [Austin and Ali laugh] 

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Art: You know, that's why you make a lot of— you know, that didn't get brought up last time.

Austin: I know. It was good, though.

Art: So I felt like I could do it again.

Austin: I chuckled at it quietly. [Ali laughs] 

Art: Yeah.

Austin: If someone identifies a loose chuckle during the last session, that was me chuckling at “Was the Grent there?” but I didn't have time to raise it.

Jack: Real Friends at the Table heads will notice—

Austin: Yeah.

Jack: —that's Austin’s chuckle at seeing the Grent, thinking about the Grent. 

Austin: [laughs] Thinking about the Grent.

Jack: Uh, I'm gonna shoot it. I'm gonna take a shot. 

Austin: Oh, okay. 

Jack: I don't see how Pickman with a rifle in a concealed position wouldn’t just open fire on this thing? 

Austin: Mm-hmm. Sure. 

Jack: And I'm gonna fire— I'm far enough away, so I'm gonna fire with my Ranged.

Austin: Mm.

Jack: It’s in Ranged mode. 

Austin: Yes.

Jack: It is, uh, D8 Kill. Brutal, that's good. 

Austin: Brutal’s good. 

Jack: Uh, Ranged.

Austin: Yeah.

Jack: Loud. Uh, you know. 

Austin: Oh yeah.

Jack: We’re in hell anyway. Tiring, that's less good. 

Austin: Mm. Give me a— give me— that sounds like a Kill, uh…

Jack: Cursed? 

Austin: Haven or— Jack, I have to tell you something. You do lose Haven now, unfortunately.

[0:20:02]

Jack: What the fuck? Why? 

Austin: ‘Cause it's not that same session anymore. 

Jack: Oh.

Austin: Yeah.

Jack: It's once per session, yeah. 

Austin: It’s once per session for the remainder of the session. 

Jack: So this is me being fucked up by scheduling.

Austin: Yeah. Well, we went— the thing is, you activated that two sessions ago—

Jack: Yeah, that’s true.

Austin: —and I was generous by saying I'll let it roll forward, because that seemed fair. You were activating at the very end of the previous session. We don't know how these episodes get cut up. But I think we are now well and truly into—

Jack: No, yeah.

Austin: —what is fair to say is the next session.

Jack: This is also— there’s a silver lining to this, which is I can power up my armor again. 

Austin: [laughs softly] This is true. Yes.

Jack: But, uh… 

Austin: [laughs softly] You could eat these varied Macula arms to get Haven, for instance, which is very funny. Just like tossing various guns and knives and stuff into the back of your armor.

Jack: Yeah. This would have to be a Haven roll, because we are within a Haven?

Austin: I don't think it's— it's not Cursed, because I know what Cursed is. Um, I’d say it could be Technology here, because it's the train station. 

Jack: Yeah, we’re in a train station. 

Austin: The train station, you're touched by the Shape here inevitably. Yeah.

Jack: Yeah. I mean, I won’t talk you down from that. I'm prepared to roll Kill Technology.

Austin: Yeah, I’ll let you have that. Yep. Mm-hmm. And take Mastery because of being hidden.

Jack: Kill, Technology.

Austin: Uh, this is Risky. 

Jack: Yep. Okay.

Austin: Fighting— and that's with it not knowing you're here and all that other shit, so. So yeah.

Jack: Would Es or Duvall take a— want to take an immediate action that I could roll into helping? I mean, I'm prepared to roll anyway, and we can sort of play it forward.

Austin: You got a pretty good roll, right? You're getting base die plus Kill plus Technology plus Mastery, so that's not bad. 

Jack: Yeah.

Austin: That's four. It’s Risky, so that's risky, but. And we should note you have seven Fortune Stress right now, so that's…that's no good, but.

Jack: Yeah. It's also, this is like…play the character, right? 

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Jack: This is the moment of, like, shoot the wax monster.

Austin: Yes. 

Jack: I'm rolling. 

Austin: Yes, yes, yes. [Jack laughs victoriously] And that's a crit, even on Risky. That's seven, nine, ten, ten.

Janine: Wow!

Austin: You lose a ten. You keep a ten. Give me your damage. Note that it's Brutal, which means you get to now roll and it goes up a die size, so it goes up from D8 to D10. You're going to roll two D10 twice and will take highest.

Jack: [impressed] I'm gonna roll two D10 twice?

Austin: Yeah, it's gonna be— you're only gonna get one of those ten, one of those dice that you roll. 

Jack: Oh, right. I see, yes. Okay.

Austin: So I guess you could roll four D10 instead, and we could take the highest of those four, right? 

Jack: Take the highest two of those four. 

Austin: The highest one. Brutal is you roll twice and keep highest. Right? 

Jack: But why am I rolling— 

Austin: Oh, I'm sorry. You're right. You're just rolling— yes. You're just rolling…I'd somehow doubled Brutal in my mind. 

Jack: Yeah.

Austin: It's not— oh! Oh, oh, oh! No, no, no, no, no. It's because you do have Brutal twice, Jack. My mind is correct about this. Because Marn gave all your shit Brutal, remember?

Jack: No, this is— yeah, this is the— when I'm in Ranged mode, the espignol doesn’t have…

Austin: Oh, it doesn't normally have it. I see. I see. I see. Gotcha, gotcha, gotcha, gotcha. 

Jack: Yes. 

Austin: I gotcha. Yes.

Jack: So I'm just gonna roll D10 twice and take the higher. 

Austin: Yes. Hey, that's a ten.

Jack: That’s a ten.

Austin: That ain't bad. Um, I will say, however, I need to double check a thing. Uh, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba…where are my tags at? Um, here we go. Tags. Okay, no, you're good. I couldn't remember if if Tiring was one of the ones that was when— oh, Loud is, ah.

Jack: Oh, no! [laughs softly] 

Austin: When you inflict Stress with this item and roll the maximum amount, which you just did—

Jack: Which I just did.

Austin: Mark D6 Stress to Fortune.

Jack: [laughs] Okay, fine. Does that count as a…okay. Does this—

Austin: Take five Fortune Stress, and give me a Fallout test. 

Jack: Does this trigger a— yeah, I was gonna say.

Austin: Oh, it sure does. You can't take it without taking it. You gotta—

Jack: Uh, I can’t go any higher. 

Austin: Why? What? 

Jack: ‘Cause the box won't let me click up higher than ten. Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve.

Austin: Oh, it won’t go over ten. That's weird.

Jack: Yeah, there we go. 

Austin: There we go.

Jack: Okay. [laughing] I have twelve Fortune.

Austin: Oh, no, you only have eleven, ‘cause you were at seven and you have one Fortune Protection, right? 

Jack: Oh, yes, you're right. Yeah. 

Austin: So, there's a chance. Give me this Fallout test, and we'll talk through all the response of what just happened. ‘Cause you did good damage. That's not noth— that 10 damage is fucking great damage.

Jack: Oh no!

Austin: Unbelievable, Jack.

Art: Oh my goodness!

Austin: Jack rolled an eleven. [Ali gasps]

Jack: [laughing] Major Fallout.

Art: That's the second highest number there is.

Austin: That’s the second highest. You’ve rolled— yeah. Wow.

Jack: Clear all Stress. 

Austin: Uh huh. 

Jack: Okay, hang on. Can I—

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Jack: A bit of flavor here. I'm not brokering with you, but this might guide—

Austin: You're allowed to broker.

Jack: This might guide— 

Austin: Yeah, go ahead. 

Jack: I can broker with you?

Austin: Listen, everything we do is a conversation on this show. 

Jack: That is true. Here’s what I'll say. The Magistrates killed Pickman’s dad. 

Austin: True.

Jack: This is something I've been thinking about.

Austin: Mm.

Jack: Pickman’s not necessarily the sort to be like, “You killed my dad,” although— and maybe in like a bar conversation but not in a fight. 

Austin: Sure.

Jack: And so I think Pickman has a real like chip on her shoulder with these guys.

Austin: Yeah.

Jack: Where she thinks that they are like violent and unnecessary. And I think that in the rolling the crit, there was this real moment of like, oh, the reason I'm able to kind of summon this power within me is that I hate these fucks and I want to prove to them that I am capable and better than them, and now—

Austin: [crosstalk] Mm-hmm. Right. Yeah.

Jack: And I did a fucking ton of damage.

Austin: Yeah. 

Jack: And now I’m taking Major Fallout.

Austin: Major.

Jack: All of which… 

Austin: Yeah.

Jack: Yeah. So if that helps in any way.

Austin: Hmm.

Jack: [laughs softly] A Ravening Beast bursts from Pickman!

Austin: [laughs] Yeah. Um, god.

Jack: I got no Stress, you know?

Austin: Yeah, your Stress is cleared, which is pretty nice, right? Um, I…okay, this is…there's a lot of things to play with here with Major Fallout Stress. And the question is…

Jack: This is precipitated by my gun being impossibly loud, right?

Austin: That's a key thing, right? It's about the loudness of the gun. Which it could also theoretically be— the other half of this is there is also the character of you having critted and then rolled max damage, right?

Jack: Yeah. In a train station.

Austin: So I think that should also be part of where this goes. And I— the thing is that, like, there is a Fortune Fallout attached to this creature that we could just jump in. Like, I could just pull that out right now, ‘cause it's…it's not good, you know? [Jack laughs] But at the same time, I feel like, is it ready? Am I ready to pull that card out? Or do I want to try to find something that's more sticky and more connected to this, your current situation, you know? Um…the most— the easiest one from Fortune Major is No Way Out: “You lead the party into a dead end, a trap or an ambush. [Jack laughs] Remove this Fallout once you get out alive.” And I kind of like that. I kind of like the idea of you shoot this thing, and the sound reverberates in such a way that it, almost out of fear, like coats the place in its own wax, sealing up all of the doors in and out. 

Jack: Ooh!

Austin: And so we get Marn instantly getting to that door, to get to— as Bucho, you know, with Bucho to like get out, and then just like the spread of this wax flesh covering everything. And it has that—

Jack: Oh my god.

Austin: It has that sickening smell of, like, too much of any one scent. Do you know what I mean? And it's just, it's the candle smell. It's the smell that comes from the Yellowfield candles, which I imagine this is kind of a soft floral, like a light floral smell. But it's still just like overwhelming in this much quantity. And also you're like, at this point, the ground, the doors, the walls are covered in this oozing, you know, wax creature that is— that faces keep appearing on and that at this point, after being shot, begins to kind of groan and moan at you. One of them looks at— I guess, who did Alaway talk to last? That was probably Es and not Marn, right? ‘Cause, Es, you were the one who got up in Alaway’s face at the end of that arc, right? 

Janine: Yeah. 

Austin: So then I think, I think wherever you're hiding, Es, the now wax-covered wall, as this stuff just continues to like spread and grow alongside the walls, one of these faces looks at you and says like: 

Austin (as Alaway): I told you I'd find you.

Janine: Eugh. 

Austin: Not good. This is all— it's all bad. So yeah, let's go with that. And that, again, that Fallout is No Way Out: “You lead the party into a dead end, a trap, or an ambush. Remove this Fallout once you get out alive.” [Ali chuckles] 

Jack: Uh, can I pitch a detail? 

Austin: Sure. 

Jack: Because we're in this train station…

Austin: Mm-hmm. 

Jack: What if it's like not just the walls and the floors and the doors, but like everything? The ticket booth, the (??? 29:30)

Austin: Oh, no, it is. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's— imagine everything has been covered. 

Jack: It’s like almost like a house of wax style… 

Austin: Yes.

Jack: Complete— like, it's a surreal landscape of this like train station interior—

Austin: Yeah. 

Jack: —where everything is now made of wax.

Austin: And wax that is skin. 

Jack: That has faces. Yes.

Austin: And that has the character of skin, you know? So.

Jack: Oh, great. Okay.

Austin: Quite literally in it. And also—

Jack: Well, I did ten damage to it. 

Austin: And at this point, is it everywhere? Yeah, you did ten damage to it, and I think part of what I want to emphasize is that like, at this point, it is almost like spread itself across this entire space. It no longer has a center. Like Sangfielle itself, to point at it and say, “Here is where its heart is,” has become increasingly difficult, you know? And I think, at this point, figures in, like, pulse up out of the wax in certain places. Some of them are humanoid in shape. Others look like creatures, like beasts. But sometimes it's just, again, a big lump of flesh. Like, a pendulum dips down from the roof or the ceiling and begins to swing towards one of the Magistrates. It hits the priest like right in the stomach and like detaches from the roof and begins to like pin her down into that corner. This is like…this is a nightmare place you’ve found yourselves in.

[0:30:46]

Ali: Mm-hmm. 

Jack: Incredible.

Ali: I don't want to tell anybody what they should do. [laughs softly] 

Austin: Uh huh?

Ali: But because I listened to last session this morning, I believe that Duvall has like a crowbar that can do Kill damage?

Jack: Oh.

Austin: That’s true. 

Art: Mm-hmm.

Ali: It sounds like you could open a door with one of those.

Austin: You could certainly try. [Ali laughs] 

Art: Kill! That! Door!

Ali: Art, if you have other ideas, by all means. That's the first thing that came to my mind. 

Art: Mm-hmm.

Ali: The very sharp hive tool, question mark?

Art: Hive tool is the—

Austin: Hive tool is right. 

Art: —is the item you're referring to. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Yeah. 

Art: Um…yeah, I didn't think that's how we were gonna get out of this, but I'd be happy— what the— what is— what's that roll look like, though? I don't have those skills. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: You almost certainly do. [Jack laughs] Let's see. We know—

Art: What’s a—

Austin: You have Technology. Delve. It is Delve. 

Art: It’s a Delve?

Austin: Or Mend. It's Delve or it’s Mend, probably. Or it’s Endure.

Art: Oh, 'cause I’m fixing it by… 

Austin: Yeah. 

Art: Yeah.

Austin: Read broad, you know?

Art: Sure.

Austin: You can do it with either of those things, I think. 

Art: All right, yeah. Uh, yeah, Duvall will… 

Austin: It could also be Kill.

Art: …say scurry. Scurry isn’t— I don’t have Kill.

Austin: Okay.

Art: And I'm not hunting it.

Austin: Uh huh.

Ali: Mm-hmm.

Austin: It's everywhere. It's kind of hard to hunt, in a sense, ‘cause you know exactly where it is.

Art: Yeah. I don't want to say Duvall scurries. That's a— that's like an image I don't want.

Austin: Mm. 

Art: ‘Cause Duvall has a more like…I guess scurrying is kind of manic, but…yeah, I don't know. Duvall does not scurry, but does a manic, uh, kind of shuffle over. I actually…eh, it's not important. Let's not get into how Duvall runs right now.

Austin: Wait, why? How's Duvall run? 

Jack: Yeah.

Austin: Now I got— now we gotta get into it.

Art: You know the— in the introduction to The Venture Bros. cartoon.

Jack: Oh.

Austin: Uh huh.

Art: One of them like sort of just like runs with their arms straight down. 

Austin: Yeah. That's how Duvall runs? 

Art: I think so, yeah. 

Austin: [laughs softly] That's very funny. 

Jack: I gotta look this up.

Art: I think like the disconnected way of being Duvall manifests itself in that way. 

Austin: Mm, mm-hmm. I'm gonna link an image for people who don't know this. It's very funny to me. 

Art: I think it’s Hank, right? It’s Hank?

Austin: I think it’s Hank. Hank is the jock, right?

Art: Yeah.

Jack: Oh yeah, I see this. 

Austin: There you go. [laughs softly] It’s very good.

Jack: Is this just because Duvall doesn't need to move his body in the way that humans do when they run?

Art: No, I— that can't be, right? Because that's just about balance. Balance still exists, right?

Jack: I mean, I don't know. 

Austin: Maybe you—

Jack: Are bugs internal stabilizers?

Austin: Yeah, maybe.

Art: Maybe. 

Austin: I don't know.

Art: Yeah, maybe they can just like shift around—

Jack: Oh.

Art: —and so this is a more efficient way of moving.

Austin: Sure. You're not using your arms. You know, saving energy.

Art: And like that T-1000 kind of thing where like—

Austin: Oh.

Art: —Duvall runs without blinking or breathing hard.

Austin: Right, yeah. 

Art: Because just like…

Austin: You've offloaded those needs. Yeah. 

Art: Right, respiratory things are just different. I really didn’t mean to turn—

Austin: T-1000 does run…does run with all of his arms, though. 

Art: Right, no, not that part. 

Austin: Not that part.

Art: It’s, but, not that part of that. 

Austin: Yeah. 

Art: I've recently heard how hard it was for the actor to run without…

Jack: Wow. 

Austin: Without seeming…

Art: Without being like, you're running.

Jack: I was just wondering how he did this. 

Austin: Yeah. 

Art: It's quick shots, I think is the trick. [laughs] 

Austin: That makes sense. 

Art: That you can run without breathing for five seconds. [laughs] 

Austin: Right, right.

Jack: [laughs] And then you fall over.

Austin: All right.

Ali: Yeah, I guess you have like 2 million lungs instead of just the two.

Jack: Oh, wow.

Austin: Right.

Ali: So it gets spread out.

Austin: Yeah.

Art: Or just like, little— like, if the lungs are still in there, it's just like the bugs can move the lungs without—

Austin: They're breathing into it. Right.

Art: Yeah.

Ali: Mm.

Austin: That's the thing. ‘Cause Art, you and I had a really good conversation, a brief one, the other day of realizing that a good way to zero in on who— what— how to think about Duvall and the bugs is in contrast to the captain of the Jade Moon who was a bunch of bugs, whereas you have a bunch of bugs. Right? 

Art: Right. 

Austin: Like, you are not fundamentally at, in your heart of hearts, like literally, you currently might have a waxen heart, but that heart is not just a bunch of coalesced bugs. It is…

Art: Right. And it does theoretically move something like blood around.

Ali: Mm.

Austin: [amused noise] Right, exactly, yes. You are still one person.

Janine: I'm now just picturing a bunch of bugs working some bellows.

Austin: Yes. I mean, that's— 

Art: Yeah. 

Austin: That's not wrong in some ways, right? So.

Art: Especially in this situation. 

Austin: Right. Anyway, you're gonna try to crowbar open a door.

Art: Yeah. 

Austin: And also the wax between it.

Art: Yeah. Oops.

Ali: I can help. 

Art: Yeah. Great.

Austin: Yeah, this makes sense. So, Duvall, you head towards the door that Bucho and Marn are at. That again will be Delve or Mend and Technology or Haven, Risky.

Art: Risky, but I am getting help.

Ali: Mm-hmm.

Art: So it’s plus one.

Austin: Plus one. All right, eight. Take no Stress. Give me your…what is the damage on that thing, Art? On that hive tool? 

Art: Uh, D4 Kill Brutal.

Austin: Give me two D4, then. And we'll take high.

Art: Uh, if I hit this, does it know what Brutal does? Or I— 

Austin: I don't think so. 

Art: It doesn’t. Okay.

Austin: You just hit it twice if you want.

Art: That's a four.

Austin: That's a four. All right.

Ali: Nice. 

Austin: Um, you manage to get it into the like, the, past the wax and into the door itself, but you find— like, into the where the actual door is. But you find that the wax has begun to like try to seal shut the lock. 

Art: Ugh.

Austin: This single attempt is not enough to completely dislodge this thing at this point.

Art: Is this a…?

Austin: I’m listening. 

Art: Is this heartsblooded?

Austin: I would say that this counts his heartsblooded at this point. What’s your—

Art: And is it a creature?

Austin: I think it's right on the line of what— read me the move. [Ali laughs softly] 

Art: “Against heartsblooded people or creatures—”

Austin: Oh, it’s a people or….

Art: “—your touch functions as a Kill D8 weapon.”

Austin: It's certainly a— it's certainly a people or a creatures. [Austin and Ali laugh softly] 

Art: Sure. But this isn't a— it's not like a thing.

Austin: It's not a door or a…it's not a tree. It’s not a…

Art: It's not a goo.

Austin: I think a goo is a creature in our scenario here. 

Art: Okay.

Austin: If it's heartsblooded. Heartsblooded is a weird term. That means something more specific in Heart than it does for us. I could say Course-touched, for instance, but I think that's too limited, given— you know, in Heart, the game Heart, there is one heart, and so a lot of things fall under heartsblooded. 

Art: Sure.

Austin: For us, between the inclusion of the Course and the Shape and the Structure, that's already three kind of competing heart scale, you know, things. This isn't quite those things, but it's close enough that I'm gonna say it counts as a…this specifically, in a way that maybe even the three Caprak, waxen Caprak that y'all fought or that you ran into down in Yellowfield didn't count. I think this big wax flesh interior monster thing you're part of probably should count for this move. So yeah, do you want to instead roll that? Is that what you're thinking? 

Art: I’m just wondering—

Austin: Or do you want to do a different roll?

Art: Well, no, 'cause I think that we should…we should take this, that that—

Austin: Yes. Yeah.

Art: That using this tool was right for this.

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Art: But as we try to keep getting through, I should—

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Art: As it's becoming clear that it's not about getting through the door.

Austin: Yeah.

Art: It’s about getting through…more?

Austin: And so I think, in this moment, as you start to do this—and maybe to communicate what this thing is—you know, tendrils and, and almost like, uh, like maws, like big…as you try to stab in, at one point, it just opens up as if to try to take the crowbar— or the hive tool from you and bite down on it. Like, just a mouth opens up to try to take it from you. But then also these tendrils are kind of punching out and trying to stab at you. Hands are coming up from the ground to try to reach up and hold you in place and disarm you. And you're like, okay, this is a creature. This thing is alive in a way that is hard to…this isn't just like a moss or a fungus growth or something. Not that— not that those are not alive, but you know what I mean. This is a people or a creature.

Art: This is a people or a creature. 

Austin: Yes.

Art: So yeah, we should— we should do some more stuff, and when we come back to me trying to get through this door—

Austin: You're gonna move onto this other move.

Art: I'll use Annihilation, yeah.

Austin: [laughs softly] Sounds good. Es, what are you up to?

Janine: Uh, mm…um, good question. Uh, I'm trying to think of the best way to help, and… [sighs] I think I want to like fall back on an old favorite but in a new way. 

Austin: Uh huh. 

Janine: Um, I think we're beyond the point of this thing having a mouth and nose. 

Jack: Oh.

Austin: I mean, we— I just described it as having many mouths and noses, but.

Janine: Yeah, a mouth.

Austin: Yeah.

Janine: So beyond the point of a mouth and nose.

Austin: Yeah.

[0:40:00]

Janine: I want to…I want to like try to extract its consciousness.

Austin: Mm. Mm-hmm.

Janine: In that way that I do. 

Austin: Oh, okay. Yeah. 

Janine: Which feels like it should still be doable. [laughs softly] 

Austin: I mean, I think this is a real— it's gonna remain Risky, because it's risky to do this.

Janine: Yes, yeah.

Austin: I think that we should really think about that in relation to what the fuck am I reaching into at this point, you know?

Janine: Yeah.

Austin: So this is Exsanguinate, I'm guessing?

Janine: Yeah. This has always been more, you know, in my head this is more about just like connecting with the consciousness part of things. 

Austin: Yep. 

Janine: And less about like the physicality part of it. 

Austin: Yeah.

Janine: ‘Cause we got rid of the blood that it's originally supposed to be. 

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Janine: So that's Kill D6 Ranged plus Piercing.

Austin: So I’d say, again, this is Kill plus Haven or Technology. And Risky.

Janine: I don’t have either of those.

Austin: You don't. This is a Risky roll. This is— this is dange— the thing that you're doing carries a lot of risk, given the dice that you have, is a thing worth saying. 

Janine: Yeah.

Austin: I don't know if somebody can help you with that or if you have another way of getting Mastery or Protection or something, but I'm just signaling.

Janine: Um…do I have another way? I don't think I do. We've used up all our…

Austin: Yeah. 

Janine: …um, thingies.

Austin: [amused] Mm-hmm.

Janine: Premonitions or whatever. Uh…

Austin: That is true. You did.

Janine: And I’ve used up all my dance bonuses.

Austin: That's true. No more dance bonuses. 

Janine: So yeah, I think we’re just, uh…

Austin: We’re just kind of in it, huh?

Janine: I think so. 

Austin: Oh, are you in True Form?

Janine: Oh. 

Austin: ‘Cause that would give you Mastery.

Janine: I mean— yeah, I think that's probably the thing to do, right?

Austin: Yeah.

Janine: Especially 'cause I don't have to roll to do that. 

Austin: Nope. Yeah, you can just be in it.

Janine: I think also that's a pretty reasonable reaction to the big wax thing calling Es out.

Austin: Oh, yeah. Yeah. 

Janine: Is like, okay, we're not hiding anymore. This is…we’re in it.

Austin: I'm gonna add another gross detail to this, if that's acceptable.

Janine: [nervous] Uh huh? [Art laughs]

Austin: To the scenario, 'cause I realized it's covered the glass…it’s covered the glass roof. It’s covered all the windows. So how is anyone seeing anything? And I think it has little wicks like hair. 

Jack: Oh!

Austin: And some of them have caught fire to light the place in candlelight, which presumably even it needs to see by. But they're like wiggling around, the wicks are.

Janine: [hesitant] Cool, okay. 

Austin: Like, in a real gross way. You know? 

Janine: So another reason to fly is that I can be in the middle of the space and not be touched by any of that shit at all.

Austin: [crosstalk] Yes. [laughs] Yes. Uh huh. Yeah. Uh huh.

Janine: Cool, okay.

Austin: I think there's a visual— there's almost a visual, like, not mirroring but a…maybe there's a contrast between your jellyfish-like hair stuff in your true form—

Janine: Eyelashes.

Austin: Your lashes and its wick hair, you know? It's…you’ve described yours as somehow enthralling and beautiful, you know?

Janine: Mm-hmm.

Austin: Your, the true form is. This is not that. This has no interest in being that in this moment. Maybe it could, in another moment. 

Janine: Ugh.

Austin: But this is, you know. If hair could wiggle in syncopation, it would be doing it now. And also some of it's lit on fire as candles, candle wicks. Anyway, you should roll Kill. [Austin and Janine laugh softly] 

Janine: Uh, that was Haven and Technology…

Austin: So that's Kill, Haven, Mastery, Risky. Yeah. 

Janine: Don’t have either of those, right. Okay.

Austin: Yep. [sympathetic] Ooh.

Janine: Okay, that's not great.

Austin: Two, five, eight. You're gonna take some Stress here. 

Janine: Mm-hmm.

Austin: Uh, okay. You should take three Stress to…I think this is probably…this is probably Echo Fallout. This is a fucking weird, gross wax thing that's trying to get into your…it's trying to— let's just say it's trying to do some dark magic shit at this point, especially to you, Es, who it particularly fought against, or who they, who Alaway fought against, right? So take three Echo, and give me, um…and give me a what-do-you-call-it check. 

Janine: No Fallout. 

Austin: No Fallout, okay.

Jack: Nice.

Austin: It's eleven versus five. I guess we should say you have three Echo now and two Fortune.

Janine: Mm-hmm.

Austin: Duvall, you have two Fortune. Pickman what do you have? I guess none, ‘cause you just got that Major Fallout—

Jack: None. I’m all good. 

Austin: —that trapped all of you in here. And then, Marn?

Jack: Okay, well. [Austin and Janine laugh] 

Austin: Marn has three Mind, one Blood? There we go. Okay. All right, so now we’re, I'd say, back Marn. Do you want to do a thing?

Ali: Yeah, I…

Austin: ‘Cause I know we kind of narrated, but…

Ali: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I, um…I had an idea that I need to slightly edit. [laughs] But I…

Austin: Mm-hmm. Oh, I should— one second. Let me give color to the Es fail.

Ali: Okay.

Austin: Because you got Fallout. Or you got Stress, but didn’t get Fallout. I think as you try to reach around and find its consciousness in there, you recall that you couldn't find an aura to it before when you tried to see its aura. And you're certain that there is something like a consciousness here, ‘cause it's reacting and it's, and it's hard to, you know, it's— sorry. It's reacting. It has a plan. It's making decisions. That means that there's a consciousness in there. You're having a hard time pinning it down. And then it strikes you that there might not be a consciousness. There might, in fact, be many consciousnesses inside of it. And so you reach— maybe you even reach in and pull out something, but it's like, you know, it's like, what if you stepped on one of Duvall's bees, right? Which doesn't mean this couldn't work, but it means you'll have to find a…you know, in the sort of grammar of how you use this maneuver, you'll have to find another way to grab hold, you know? The difference between using a fork and a spoon.

Ali: [quietly] Get a big net?

Janine: Great.

Austin: Mm-hmm. [Ali laughs] 

Janine: For the record, if I stepped on one of Duvall’s bees, I would apologize. 

Ali: Mm.

Austin: Aw, that's nice. All right, Marn.

Art: Don't apologize now, though. That would be… [Austin and Ali laugh] 

Ali: Yeah, so I— my original idea was like dropping like a flare or something to like create fire to like sort of melt the wax that's coming towards us—

Austin: Mm. Yeah.

Ali: —to like stop the encroachment to give Duvall some time, but I think that makes more sense with this candle situation—

Austin: Yeah. 

Ali: —if it's like an acid or something instead? ‘Cause I…

Austin: Ooh.

Ali: Both things I could reasonably believe that is in Marn’s backpack.

Austin: Yeah. Yeah, easy to think about your supplies having some of that stuff, right?

Ali: Uh huh. Is this like a Kill Supplies roll? Like, what even is this? [laughs] 

Austin: You would take…what I would say is to produce something like that, 'cause that's pretty, that's a pretty…that's like a pretty specific thing. I think you should probably take Supply Stress to just say you have a thing in that way. I'm double checking it. Here we go. [reading] “It's assumed the player characters have more on hand than what's written on their character sheet—it's no fun to keep a precise inventory of everything the character owns at all times. Assume that players have access to—”

Art: True story.

Austin: Uh huh. “It's assumed that player characters have access to basic supplies—food, spare change, rope, lantern, fuel, bedding, et cetera—as represented by Supplies resistance. They can mark Stress to it to show that they're using up materials, and if they suffer Supplies Fallout, they have a problem on their hands.” So I would say, you know, take a Supply Stress after this roll, which means you will have to roll Fallout Protection to have produced this sort of thing. But I think that that's fair, and I won't make you roll it twice if you also get Stress here. Do you know what I mean? So if you fail the roll, I'm not gonna also make you roll…I'm not gonna make you roll Supply, or you know, a Fallout test twice.

Ali: Oh, sure, sure, sure. 

Austin: If that makes sense. 

Ali: So add the Supply Stress now, one Supply Stress.

Austin: Yeah, go ahead and add that one Supply Stress, past your—

Ali: And then… 

Austin: I know you have Protection, but add one. Yeah.

Ali: Oh, sure, sure. Okay. And then I guess this is a Kill Haven?

Austin: It sounds like…it sounds like if you have— it could be Kill Haven, it could be…I guess, again, are you trying to…what are you trying to do with it? You're trying to…

Ali: I think that I'm just trying to like create like a, like, just a space around us to buy some time.

Austin: Yeah.

Ali: ‘Cause like, presumably there's more wax flooding towards us.

Jack: Oh, wow.

Austin: There sure is. 

Ali: It’s gonna be— we’re gonna be knee deep. Or not knee deep, but like ankle deep.

Austin: You might be knee deep, soon enough. [Ali laughs] 

Jack: Oh. I can feel—

Austin: More of it is— there is more of it than there should be. 

Ali: Sure.

Austin: Is a thing I should— I want to say. Like, again, it was like, it was just in the little plate armor. It was like a big— it was a big guy, but it wasn't this, you know?

Ali: Uh huh.

Austin: So it does feel like there is more of it coming from somewhere.

Ali: Yeah. I think…timeline in the game time, it is maybe starting to get like above the curve of the shoe, you know? 

Austin: Yes, totally. 

Ali: And Marn is trying to like pour all of this out, around.

Austin: Mm-hmm. I think in the same way that…in the same way that Duvall got to use Mend or Kill or Delve, I feel like this— you're effectively trying to do the same thing, right? Which is like, change the environment in some way. 

Ali: Mm-hmm.

Austin: I think the thing you're doing probably is Delve, progress into dangerous or unknown territory. You can imagine this being like you're going through a tunnel and you've come across some like cursed goo and you're trying to clear the cursed goo with your acid. I think that makes sense. 

Ali: Oh, sure, sure. Okay, yeah.

Austin: Right? So I'd say Delve. Delve, Haven, or Technology. 

Ali: Okay.

Austin: And then it sounded like Pickman wanted to potentially help?

Jack: Yeah, I was just, I didn't know how high the wax was getting, and if it was— [Ali laughs softly] 

Austin: Yeah.

Jack: And if it was Marn danger, at which point I could jump down and Marn could ride on the back of Pickman’s armor.

Austin: That’s very fun.

Ali: Oh, sure.

Jack: But at that point…if we're just above Marn’s shoe, that doesn't seem so bad. I would still jump down and get into melee range and I could help you there, though, if you wanted to take the extra dice.

Ali: Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Austin: Yeah. Just hop down there and make sure that like the various wax tendrils stay the fuck away while Marn is applying… [Ali laughs] 

Jack: Like a third Shape Knight joins Marn in the fray. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Yeah, uh huh. Yeah, yeah, totally. Alekest is here also. That's fair enough.

Jack: Big splash of wax as Pickman lands.

Austin: Yeah. Ooh, success at a cost.

Jack: Oh.

Ali: Okay. 

Jack: Ooh.

Austin: To both of you, huh? [Ali laughs] Uh huh. 

Jack: Oohoo.

Austin: Okay, so here is Marn. Oh, look at that. 

Jack: Oh! 

Austin: Only one. 

Ali: Sure.

Austin: Not bad. And then to Pickman. [Ali gasps] Okay, you know? That was the…that’s five to Pickman. Again, I'm gonna say that this is Echo Fallout for both of you, as the situation becomes more and more unhinged. 

[0:50:13]

Jack: Okay.

Austin: So, go ahead and give me Fallout tests, both of you. This is the wax begins to kind of get into your shoes. You can feel it moving around inside of your boots.

Jack: Oh, god. [Ali laughs softly] 

Austin: Pickman, you can feel it start to run up your leg, which is not a good feeling. 

Jack: Oh, yeah, 'cause gen—

Austin: No Fallout for Marn.

Jack: Generally, I can't feel through the armor, but I have this—

Austin: Uh huh.

Jack: Remember that like I got the flu, and it sort of made my armor…I have the Sanguinary Array now.

Austin: Oh, right. Yeah.

Ali: Oh, yeah.

Jack: Where I'm like slightly more connected to my armor. 

Austin: Mm.

Jack: Okay.

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Jack: Let's just roll a Fortune test. Okay, phew.

Austin: And that is no Fallout. Wait, is that right? Yeah, I guess so. Yeah. Nice.

Jack: Yeah, you gave me five, and I have one Echo Protection.

Austin: You have one Echo Protection. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Gotcha. All right. Where are we at now? I guess, are we back to you, Duvall? As this acid unfortunately…or I guess, no, you also did the acid. You did do the acid here, Marn, right? You succeeded. It was just success at a cost. 

Ali: Mm-hmm.

Austin: So give me, give me…I think for that I would say give me D4.

Ali: Oh, sure.

Austin: And we'll call it like Piercing, right? ‘Cause like, it’s built— you've made a thing to quickly pierce through this stuff. 

Ali: Oh, yeah, and um… 

Austin: So just give me a flat D4.

Ali: I actually, I haven't mentioned this move, but I have the Trench-Fighter skill now.

Austin: Ooh.

Jack: Whoa. 

Ali: And when I attack at close range, your attacks gain the Piercing tag, even if you're armed. And I feel like this counts as an unarmed Piercing attack.

Austin: There we go. This counts. This is perfect, yeah. So yeah, give me D4. And there's a four.

Ali: Four.

Austin: That's pretty fucking good. It… [sighs] The room echoes in…or the room itself bellows, and the sound begins to echo back and forth in here, but it only echoes for like a beat or two, because the wax swallows up the sound, right? It's a wonderful sonic insulator to be in a room covered, you know, top to bottom in wax.  At this point—

Jack: That’s what they say.

Austin: That's what they always say. 

Ali: We should put the (??? 52:10) in here.

Austin: I really want to get a— [laughs] Yeah. we should record the podcast in this big wax room. [Ali laughs] I think the size probably still produces too much echo, but.

Ali: Mm.

Jack: Too much reflection off the shiny wax. 

Austin: Yeah, you're probably right. I should say, at this point, Dr. Kerr Kern, the other Telluricist, has been trying to cut free Lejune, the priest. And Rebek, at this point, has like taken cover behind the ticket desk and has been firing bullets into the various, you know, beings that pop up out of this thing, 'cause again, sometimes a whole-ass person will show up out with a wax, and Rebek has been shooting them down as they pop up. And I think, at this point, probably calls out to y'all and is like, um…how would she say it? I already— last time I said, like, she can't say devilry. [laughs] But says:

Austin (as Rebek): What did you do with my friend? You turned him into a goddamn creature.

Ali (as Marn): Do we look like we're involved in this?

Austin (as Rebek): [stammers briefly] We're not. You're the only other ones here.

Janine (as Es): Also, the wax monster is here. [Ali laughs] 

Ali (as Marn): I'm trying to get out of here.

Austin (as Rebek): So you're telling me you're not in any way responsible for this?

Janine (as Es): We would have been on the other side of the fucking doors if we were. [Jack laughs] 

Austin (as Rebek): [sighs] Somehow, I sense I don’t have the whole—

Janine (as Es): We could have let y'all hang out in here. 

Austin (as Rebek): Somehow I sense I don't have the whole story.

Ali (as Marn): Well, it's a long story, and we gotta go.

Austin (as Rebek): It always is with you motherfuckers.

Ali (as Marn): Fuck off!

Art (as Duvall): Whoa! [after Marn] Yeah!

Jack: [laughs] Shut the fuck up Friday. [Austin and Janine laugh] 

Austin: Um, who's up? Who's moving? Who's doing stuff?

Jack: Yeah, I'll shoot at it again. [Austin laughs softly] 

Ali: Oh, is… 

Austin: Yeah?

Janine: I have a…I have two questions. 

Austin: Mm-hmm?

Janine: One: have we fully walked away from the train thing? [laughs softly] 

Austin: Mm. 

Janine: ‘Cause I feel like we’ve maybe looped around to a point where the chaos of a horrible train has a 50/50 chance of…

Jack: Oh…

Ali: Mm-hmm.

Janine: You know?

Ali: I was thinking today that we should raise this, ‘cause it might [sing-songy] fulfill your beat, Pickman.

Jack: Yeah.

Austin: It might fulfill a couple of beats here, honestly.

Ali: It might be majestic if this train kills the… [laughs] People might find that very majestic.

Jack: It might— I mean, who’s the outsider here? [laughs] It could be Rebek, being like…

Janine: The less glamorous…

Jack: I and Pickman…both Pickman and me— no. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Uh huh.

Jack: Pickman believes that trains should not really be used for things, pretty firmly.

Austin: Uh huh.

Janine: Mm-hmm.

Jack: I think that getting trains on screen smashing things is good television.

Austin: Uh huh.

Jack: But I do think it will destroy Blackwick if this goes wrong, and I can't make Pickman make a case for this.

Austin: Well, I have good news for you, which is you don't get to decide that. Duvall is the one with the torch.

Jack: Yes, that is— yes. In fact, I'll put that another way. I think Pickman would actively advocate against using this—

Austin: Mm. 

Jack: Because it's like, oh, we're fighting a lion. Should we introduce a tiger? Um… [Austin laughs] But yeah, again, Duvall has the torch. I just wanted—

Austin: And the Beat “Destroy a Haunt to learn more about your task.”

Jack: Yeah, 100 percent. [Janine laughs] I just, um…

Art: I don't 100 percent know what I learn by this, but it’s not over yet. 

Austin: Well, maybe it opens a new door. Yeah, exactly. 

Art: Yeah.

Austin: You know.

Art: You don't— it doesn't say that your intent when you do it has to be to learn. It just… 

Austin: Yeah, yeah.

Jack: I just wanted to reiterate that Pickman might have a complicated relationship with trains [Ali laughs] but is still firmly on the “don't use them as tools for your own personal endeavors” team. 

Austin: Yes, yes.

Art: Mm-hmm. And I hear that, and I respect it. But…

Austin: Mm.

Jack: Oh, you're gonna have southern Blackwick eaten by a train? [Jack and Ali laugh] 

Art: Things are just bad right now. 

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Art: And…

Jack: Oh my god. [laughs softly] Shining it through the wax window. Ugh.

Art: Uh huh. I mean, I could do one more attempt of like trying to burn through this door.

Austin: Yeah. You said you wanted to try Annihilation, right?

Art: I did, yeah.

Austin: Yeah. We can try it. Let's try it. What’s that look like? We haven't seen this used yet, right? This is…

Art: We have. I, uh…right when I took it, I really messed up that guy. 

Austin: That guy. 

Art: Not guy. When, uh, when Chine and them got in big trouble?

Ali: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

Austin: When Chine and them got in big trouble. 

Art: On the boat? 

Ali: I think—

Austin: On the boat.

Ali: When Chine—

Austin: I don’t remember this at all.

Art: Not on the boat. 

Ali: When Chine got off at the train station—

Austin: Oh, I recall.

Ali: And then Duvall and Pickman showed up to help them. 

Austin: Yes. Yes. 

Jack: Oh, yeah!

Ali: And then like Duvall basically just like killed that…

Austin: One shot the thing again, did the classic… 

Art: One shot.

Ali: That side boss? Yeah. [laughs] 

Austin: Yeah, uh huh. Yeah. Yes. 

Ali: And Chine was like, meh. 

Austin: Yeah, I recall this now. Yes. All right, well.

Ali: I keep thinking of this, ‘cause I think Duvall has done the most damage of this show?

Jack: Yes. The thing Duvall feels like to me is— 

Austin: I believe it.

Art: It’s about picking your spots. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: [laughs softly] Yes.

Jack: Duvall feels like a level 80 character in a level 15 zone, [Ali and Austin laugh] when he’s firing on all cylinders, where you're just like, “Oh, that thing? That is dead now.”

Austin: Uh huh. Unfortunately, that is not always the case. [Jack chuckles] 

Ali: Mm-hmm.

Austin: Sometimes Duvall is the literal opposite, and that’s just luck. Or is it? Question mark, question mark, question mark.

Art: Or is it, question mark. 

Austin: All right. Well, this sounds to me like Kill and Technology again, Duvall. Or you don't have Kill, still, huh?

Art: I don’t have Kill.

Austin: Huh. Mm, well, that— this really feels like Kill. [Ali laughs] This is not Mend or Delve. I think using the move Annihilation, [Jack laughs] “your touch functions as a Kill D8 weapon,” is a Kill roll.

Art: I mean I think in some situations, it’s Hunt. It's just not this situation.

Austin: Yeah, this is not Hunt. This is certainly not Hunt. So is anyone helping Duvall do some killing?

Jack: Sure. Sure.

Austin: Uh, I’m gonna say not Pickman, because Pickman, you literally just helped Marn on this one. 

Jack: I'm busy, yeah.

Austin: So I guess, really, it's like, Es, do you want to be part of this, this next attempt from Duvall? 

Janine: Um…

Austin: Or do you want to save your action, so to speak?

Janine: So, I had a… [sighs] I…so, the other question I was gonna ask is like, is the…is it an option here to, instead of trying to pry something open, to, you know the wax covered windows? 

Austin: Mm-hmm?

Janine: To try and like smash them and blah, blah, blah. But I think the thing I'm getting hung up again on like, well, the roll’s the roll.

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Janine: If you succeed, you succeed. If you don't, you don’t. Um, so yes, I will help Duvall. I have Kill.

Austin: All right. Take that—

Art: All right.

Austin: Take that extra die, Duvall. 

Art: Plus one. 

Austin: Still Risky.

Art: [simultaneously] Still Risky? 

Austin: Oh, yeah. Success at—

Art: That's a ten! 

Austin: It's not a ten. 

Art: It’s a ten!

Austin: It’s not. 

Art: A six is a ten! 

Austin: Oh, a six is a ten! The ten gets removed, but the six is a ten. [Janine and Jack laugh] 

Art: Yeah. 

Austin: Yeah. Okay, Duvall rolled a one, six, ten. [Ali laughs] 

Jack: It’s so good.

Austin: And, as a reminder, when Duvall rolls a six, because of Majestic, once per situation—

Art: Once per situation.

Janine: Wow.

Austin: When you roll to resolve an action and you roll a six, count that dice as if it rolled a ten. So we can either take that one away and you’d still have a ten, or we can take the 10 away and you get the six that's a ten. So, love it. All right, that's a critical success, which again, boosts this damage [laughs] from D8 up to D10. Right?

Art: Uh huh.

Austin: So, give me that D10.

Art: And it is Kill and it is also Debilitating. 

Austin: Debilitating. Well, that’s fun.

Art: And causes crystal to coalesce around the targets.

Jack: Oh!

Austin: Okay. Well, give me this roll. This could be big.

[1:00:00]

Art: [suspenseful pause] One. [Jack and Janine laugh] It could have been big.

Austin: It could have been big.

Janine: And you have an ability that makes ones into what number? [Ali laughs] 

Jack: No, wait. Doesn’t Art— doesn’t Art roll two D10s, because it’s Brutal?

Austin: No.

Art: No, this isn’t Brutal.

Austin: Brutal was applied to the hive tool. 

Jack: Oh, shit. [laughs softly] Okay. 

Austin: Uh huh, yeah. Yeah, unfortunately, unfortunately. 

Art: How many dice do I roll for debilitating? 

Austin: Uh, it's not a die-based thing. [Jack laughs] What debilitating says is, “Once per situation, when you inflict Stress with this item on one or more targets, the next attack made against them is rolled with Mastery.” So you've given someone Mastery on their next roll here. I think all of the…you touch this thing— again, how do you apply this damage? Is this like a…a touch?

Art: It’s you touch— I'll read the thing, ‘cause it's great. 

Austin: Uh huh.

Art: “As you use it, your flesh roils and cracks, but the swarm repairs it as quickly as it is unmade. Your opponent doesn't have that luxury.” 

Austin: So yeah, I think a lot of the…the kind of the moisture of the wax gets sucked away, gets evaporated into nothing here. Your bugs are chowing down on some delicious, you know, water that's inside of the wax content, and it dries out and becomes brittle for this brief moment. And you can feel that like, and maybe again, this is, especially with your like aura vision at this moment, Es, you can see that there is a part of this creature, this vast room-shaped now creature, where more of its kind of lifeblood is flowing out, and it will remoisturize from there and be able to get its kind of flexibility and its sort of like form back or its ability to take these hits. But in this moment, it is extra fucking brittle. So that one damage doesn't really do anything, but that Mastery is very useful for two things. One is I think the next hit is gonna do more damage. And then two, Es, you identify that there is a kind of central…it's not the single piece of consciousness, but it is like the equivalent of seeing someone's brain or heart or a core, you know, junction in its being. And I'm gonna say that that is in the ticket booth. It has hidden itself in the ticket booth behind the glass, so you— it’s as if there's a figure standing in the ticket booth behind the wax-covered windows and doors, you know? But in your kind of aura vision, you can sense it in there.

Janine: Hypothetically…

Austin: Mm-hmm?

Janine: What if a person had three stacks of dynamite? 

Austin: Uh huh? [Jack laughs] 

Ali: [intrigued] Oh.

Art: [intrigued] Mm.

Austin: That's a good question.

Janine: Just like a…just like a hypothetical curious thing.

Austin: Yeah. I'd say that that's a…

Janine: That a person could have.

Austin: That's a good direction. Yeah, uh huh. I think that's probably Kill. [laughs softly] 

Janine: Yeah, that seems like— I guess I'd have to pick one, right? I mean…

Austin: What? One what? 

Janine: One stack of dynamite to use?

Austin: You could use all these here if you want to. 

Ali: Yeah.

Austin: I'm not gonna say no to that. That's fine. 

Janine: There's fire hair everywhere. I feel like I'd be able to light stuff fast.

Austin: Oh, definitely. 

Ali: Uh huh.

Austin: I think you would make some sort of like, you know, uh…

Janine: Dynamite cabin?

Austin: Or like a dynamite, you know, like a satchel. You know what I mean? 

Janine: Sure.

Austin: You put it all in there. You light it. It's probably gonna all blow up.

Ali: Mm.

Austin: And you’d get Mastery on that roll, because of this previous thing.

Janine: That sounds fun. 

Austin: Uh huh. 

Ali: I like this.

Janine: What if I did that? [laughs softly] 

Austin: I'm here for it. 

Janine: Okay.

Ali: We have to get out of the building first. [laughs] I’m just…

Janine: Well…okay, but…

Ali: [laughing] Just the four of us.

Janine: What if we can't get out of the building unless this thing dies?

Ali: I don’t wanna be in here when that happens. [Ali and Janine laugh] 

Janine: Well…

Jack: [laughing] The Blackwick Group dynamites a building that they’re inside. [Janine laughs] 

Austin: It’d blow a hole in the wall. You know, you’d probably get out.

Ali: I could—

Janine: Where— yeah, is the ticket booth like against a wall, or…? 

Art: What I don’t like about this is that I'm not destroying the Haunt.

Austin: Mm, right, right.

Ali: Oh. Well, you can assist.

Austin: There's other Haunts in this town. 

Art: Mm. 

Austin: And you could assist, it's true. 

Ali: Anyway, where are we now? [laughs] 

Jack: (??? 1:04:24) other people. 

Austin: Yeah.

Jack: The Bell Metal people are gonna hate this. Blackwick destroys their own train station. 

Austin: Oh my god, yeah. At this point, I think that Kerr and Rebek have gotten Lejune, who is their priest, up. And the priest is beginning to do some sort of incantation while holding one of those prayer cards out.

Janine: Priest isn't calling the train, certainly, right? 

Austin: [“I don’t know” sound]

Ali: More likely a big thunder situation.

Jack: Oh, yeah, they do that red lightning stuff.

Janine: Oh, yeah, yeah .

Austin: They do do that red lightning stuff.

Janine: Um…I—

Austin (as Rebek): If this really ain’t you, then everybody stand back. 

Art: I hate this. 

Janine: I just wanna—

Art: I hate how this feels.

Janine: I'm gonna tell her, like, aim it at the ticket booth. 

Austin: Mm.

Janine: It's in the ticket booth. 

Austin: Okay.

Janine: If— presuming you can aim that shit. I don't fucking know, I guess. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Do you want to give me a Compel?

Janine: [unenthused] Uh…yeah, sure, why not. [Jack laughs] 

Austin: [laughs] Not Risky. Regular, regular non-Risky rolls. You're just talking to these people. Anyone helping to convince them to use their particular big explosion in a way that benefits you? 

Art: Uh, yeah, I guess I need to help anything— anyone who's trying to explode something right now. [Janine laughs] 

Austin: This is true. So, what do you say?

Art: Um, I don’t have Compel. What do I— what are the domains (??? 1:05:48)

Austin: You have Haven. You have Technology. You have Technology. Right?

Art: Technology, yeah. I don’t have Haven.

Austin: Mm. So what do you say to help convince them that Es knows what they're talking about? 

Art: I think I'm more on a…on like an architectural basis.

Austin: Mm.

Art: On a like…“and this is how you destroy it best.” 

Austin: [laughs softly] Hit it right in the ticket booth. 

Art: Hit it right in the ticket booth. That's a load bearing ticket booth. [Jack laughs]

Austin: Mm.

Janine: If you hit the decorative spire on the ticket booth, it'll conduct the electricity in a cage formation through the structure.

Austin: Uh huh. All right, give me a Compel. Plus one from Duvall’s help.

Janine: All right.

Austin: Unbelievable bad roll.

Janine: Wow. That's bad. 

Jack: Oh no.

Austin: This is an unbelievable roll.

Janine: I’ve got ground to make up for, for all the good rolls that I had before.

Austin: This is true. This is true. You do have that. 

Art: But it's a straight, so that counts as a success.

Austin: One, two, three does count. [laughs softly] 

Ali: Mm, mm-hmm.

Austin: That’s how it works. Unfortunately, it does not. All right, so this isn’t—

Janine: Yeah, I have a new power that when I get okay poker things I get a bonus.

Ali: Ooh.

Austin: I see. Right, right.

Ali: Someone should make that class.

Austin: Mm.

Jack: Yeah, it’d be great. That might just be Hazard.

Austin: Oh, that would be really fun. [Ali laughs] It kind of is just Hazard, right? All right. That is Es. That is…oh my god, six.

Janine: Wow.

Austin: Two to Es, six to Duvall. 

Janine: Oh.

Austin: Uh, as the…I'm gonna say that both of these are Blood. This is just straight up the—

Janine: I take none, then. 

Austin: Okay, well, you take none, ‘cause you have great Blood Protection now, right?

Janine: Yeah.

Jack: Art—

Austin: Art takes a bunch.

Jack: Is Duvall within arm’s reach of me?

Austin: Sure. 

Jack: Um, actually, wait, Art, I can just take this. Yeah, I can just take this for you instead, because I have really good Blood Protection. What's your Blood Protection? 

Art: One. 

Jack: Oh. I mean, I have five Blood Protection. And—

Art: Oh, so that is certainly more efficient.

Jack: Once per— 

Austin: How’d you get up to five? Wait. 

Jack: Yeah, I've… 

Austin: Go ahead. You keep talking.

Jack: Once per situation, when an ally within arm's reach would mark Stress to Blood, you mark an equivalent amount to Blood instead. 

Austin: Mm. 

Jack: Yeah, I'm almost certain that I do have five. 

Austin: I guess—

Jack: I have also gone, “I have a lot,” and I've counted it up on several occasions. 

Austin: Okay. I do believe you. I just wanted to make sure that we didn't make something permanent that isn't.

Jack: Yeah, one from Dyre Ode. 

Austin: One from Protector’s Gauntlet.

Jack: Then I got three from something, I think? Oh, two from armor plating.

Austin: Okay. That's four.

Janine: Did Marn do a thing or something?

Art: Yeah, I think that's how I have one. 

Austin: Oh. Did you get one bonus from—

Janine: ‘Cause I have— I also have one more than I usually do.

Austin: Yeah. That makes sense. 

Janine: I think Marn did some sort of Marn thing for us.

Austin: Mm-hmm. Yeah, put a note in Notes, in your Notes about having that plus one from Marn. 

Jack: Yeah. Remove…I'll just say “plus one Blood Protection from Marn.”

Austin: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. What, um…my other thing here is, wait, how are you taking this shot for Duvall? What's that move?

Jack: Uh, that move is Get Behind Me. No, it's not. I'm sorry. It's Knight Protector.

Austin: Oh. I don't— that doesn't say— no, it's not. Yeah. There we go. Okay. “Once per situation, when an ally within arm's reach would mark Stress to Blood, you may mark an equivalent Stress to Blood instead.” Yes. Okay.

Jack: So, that’s…

Austin: All right, so take one then. 

Jack: Yeah. And take a Fallout check.

Austin: ‘Cause it was six minus five. And take that Fallout test, yep. And I'll explain what happens here. 

Jack: That’s no Fallout.

Austin: No Fallout. Love that.

Art: And because I didn't take the Stress, I don’t test, right?

Austin: That is correct, yeah. So, this is one of those things where you make the— you say all the right words, but it draws the already startled and frightened Lejune’s attention out of place and towards you. And so a bolt of lightning, of red lightning, does strike through the ceiling, breaking the glass in this moment, shattering the, uh…the, you know. Someone could get— someone who can fly, for instance, could escape in this moment.

Jack: [intrigued] Mm.

[1:10:00]

Janine: That was my plan.

Austin: Uh huh. [laughs softly] 

Janine: Not that, but that was…yeah.

Austin: Part of it. And…but also coming down very close to both Es and Pickman. And Duvall and then Pickman, who gets in front of the explosion for Duvall. And Lejune, the priest, is like: 

Austin (as Lejune): [nervous] Ah! Mm. Give me a moment. I'll try again. 

Austin: And drops that— that prayer card has like gone up in smoke. And like produces another one from inside of her sleeve and begins a long incantation. Unfortunately, a worse incantation, because Lejune’s deal is that she has a handful of these prayer cards, and each of them does something, and that was her best one.

Jack: Oh no. 

Austin: So. [laughs softly] 

Janine: Ugh, these people.

Austin: I guess I should do— actually, wait. I should still do that damage. That damage still goes off. It just isn't— it didn't hit the core of this thing. [typing] Let's see. Oh, I guess this is the other part of this. This is fun, ‘cause this is the best one. Only two damage. That's like nothing. Uh, this room does begin to fill with smoke at this point.

Jack: [laughs] Oh no!

Austin: As this lightning bolt begins to catalyze with the wax, or maybe it was just something in the lightning bolt to begin with. 

Janine: Hmm.

Austin: But that— it's not the— [sighs] would you consider yourself allied with these people in this moment? Or no?

Jack: They think we did it.

Art: In this moment?

Austin: They do, but they did also say to step back before they did it, right?

Jack: Yeah, that’s true.

Austin: So I think that there's a little bit of…we’re right on the edge. 

Janine: The enemy of my enemy.

Art: They’re sort of buying our explanation.

Austin: Yeah. Well, I'll give this to you, then. You can take, um, going for— the bearer and any nearby allies reduce the damage of incoming and outgoing Ranged weapons by one step, so if this thing starts flinging wax at you or if you start getting into a gunfight with these Magistrates, the smoke is going to give you another bit of Protection, basically. [laughs softly] So I'll keep that in mind and bring it up if it's— if it comes up. Es, it sounded like you were gonna fly away?

Janine: So, my original thing about like shooting out the window was like—

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Janine: If we have an egress, do we like want to get Kerr out or something like that? You know? Like I don't know…I don't know how… [exhales] what the importance of certain bystanders is, and I'd love some feedback on like, is it a priority to get someone out, even someone in the party who wants to maybe work on the door from either side or shit like that, you know?

Ali: Uh, not super aligned with her besides the fact that she's carrying very valuable things? [laughs softly] 

Jack: Oh, all your documents?

Ali: Yeah.

Austin: Uh huh.

Ali: I think my like mission objective—like, make sure you do all of these things—is make sure she doesn't die or make sure that we don't kill her.

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Ali: I also still like, as a person, would like to prioritize like having at least something open before this shot goes off, because I think that if we're inside of a person that we are exploding, it's gonna end up really badly for us. Dice will tell us that regardless, but just fictionally, it seems bad. But yeah, I don't know where we're at with the door thing, if we want to like pivot to a window, 'cause I could get up on like Bucho’s shoulder or whatever and like try to…if there's like one of those like windows above the door or whatever.

Austin: The window that broke open, to be clear, is in the roof.

Janine: Yeah. 

Austin: It's a roof, it’s a—

Ali: Oh, sure, sure, sure.

Janine: Fly-outy type.

Austin: You know, it's like a dome. Yeah, yeah, yeah, exactly. 

Janine: Okay, what if the thing that I did was I flew out and then dynamited the other side of the door?

Ali: Um…

Jack: Is that a one dynamite type situation? 

Ali: Yeah.

Jack: Because you got three sticks.

Janine: I have— yeah, I've got— I've also got slightly weaker dynamite, if we're that scared. [Austin laughs] 

Ali: Mm-hmm.

Janine: I've got like a range. I’ve got like a bouquet.

Jack: How have you got so much dynamite? [Ali laughs] 

Austin: It’s Lyke’s dynamite that’s been split in two.

Janine: Yeah.

Austin: Plus Ennib’s like satchel charge.

Ali: Yeah.

Janine: Yep. 

Austin: Whatever that was, red bomb. I forget what— red smoke bomb or whatever.

Janine: Yeah, the red smoke charge. 

Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Ali: Normal dynamite and Occult dynamite is what we've got. 

Austin: Yes, yes, yes.

Art: Mm. 

Janine: Yeah.

Ali: But if like, if like the door is one hit from being open or whatever, and we just do that—

Austin: Uh huh.

Ali: And then close it and dynamite, that's, you know? But I don't know how we feel fictionally, where we are on that so far.

Janine: I'd be happy to give it a shot.

Jack: Yeah, I…

Austin: Give the— in other words, give the door one more whack to see if it opens up, so you can get out.

Ali: Uh huh. Right. 

Austin: And then do the big bomb explosion, versus the little, the…

Janine: Wasn’t— well, wasn't that what Duvall already did? Wasn't that already supposed to be our one last shot at the door? [Jack laughs] 

Ali: Well, Duvall took two hits at it. And I don't know…

Art: And [mumbles] it's Mastery for the next roll. It's… 

Austin: Right. 

Art: The door is weaker than ever.

Austin: And the whole thing is weaker than ever. The whole being is weaker than ever. [Ali laughs] Don’t look at me. This is a Blackwick Group decision to me. 

Ali: Oh, sure, sure. Yeah, I just don't know fictionally where we ended off with the last Duvall roll on…

Austin: I mean, Duvall did one damage.

Ali: Okay.

Austin: Is where— is what we ended on.

Ali: Okay.

Janine: Yeah. 

Austin: But debilitated it, making it hard as— 

Ali: Okay.

Austin: Hard and brittle as if something, as if one more good hit could break through it.

Ali: Sure.

Jack: I think it's worth one more good hit.

Ali: And then to set Es up to do the next action.

Jack: Yeah.

Ali: Which would be some sort of dynamite.

Jack: Yeah.

Janine: Okay.

Jack: But we'd probably need to try and make sure that we weren't dynamiting people we didn't want to dynamite. 

Ali: Sure.

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Janine: Well, we’d presumably evacuate them, and then…if I don't dynamite the door, that's one more chunk of dynamite I can use on the ticket booth, so.

Jack: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Ali: Mm-hmm.

Austin: Right. Yes. Yes.

Jack: That's beast dynamite.

Austin: All right, so who is going at the door one more time? Who's going on a big swing? 

Art: I need to save myself for helping on the dynamite roll. 

Ali: Okay. [laughs] 

Austin: I know. Yes. [Janine laughs] I do understand this. So then, Pickman or Marn.

Ali: Yeah. I mean—

Jack: I’ll take a—

Ali: Yeah.

Jack: Yeah, we could, uh…we could do a joint effort on the door.

Ali: Sure, sure, sure.

Austin: Yeah, sure. All right.

Jack: Do you want to roll or shall I? 

Austin: Who has what…where are Stresses at?

Jack: Uh…

Ali: Um, I probably— I have six Stress, so I feel like I have less Stress.

Jack: I have five Stress. 

Ali: Oh, then yeah. Do you have the Kill domain?

Jack: I do have the Kill domain.

Ali: Okay, then you should roll and I’ll assist you.

Jack: Great, cool. 

Austin: There we go. 

Jack: Uh, Kill Technology, ‘cause I'm fighting a train station.

Austin: And what are you using? Are you using the espignol? The, but like the melee part of it, or…

Jack: Yeah, yeah. I'm just going up to the door and shooting at it at point blank range. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Okay. Great.

Jack: [laughs softly] With the espignol. 

Austin: Okay, good.

Ali: [laughs] I’m just imagining Pickman like putting the barrel of the gun like against the door, like…

Jack: Yes!

Austin: Uh huh.

Jack: Yeah. You know. 

Austin: Sure. Sure. Sure.

Ali: If this doesn't work, this is truly our last attempt.

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Jack: Yeah, absolutely. And I'm taking Mastery because of Duvall?

Austin: Yeah, absolutely.

Jack: And I have plus one from Marn's help.

Ali: Mm.

Jack: How are you helping me?

Austin: Yeah. Yeah, how are you helping, Marn?

Ali: That's a great question. Before, I thought I was gonna be using this knife to try to help pry it open, but I think I'm probably taking a step back.

Austin: Now you're using a gun.

Ali: I'm probably still on like, you know, move the wax away situa— like, make sure that like at least the one foot area around us is like as clear as we can make it. 

Austin: Right. Right. Are you using like Castlevania holy water style acid [Jack laughs] just to like burn it away, to keep, to give—

Ali: Or just like kicking or like poking at it with my stick to be like— 

Austin: Yeah, sure. Yeah, uh huh.

Ali: Do not come any higher over here, please.

Austin: Mm-hmm. All right, give me that roll, Pickman. 

Jack: [disappointed] Ooh!

Austin: That’s success at a cost. Take Stress. 

Jack: But I rolled five die! Dice.

Austin: You did roll five dice, yeah. [Ali laughs] Three, four, five, six, eight. The eight gets taken away, leaving you with the six.

Jack: Yikes. 

Austin: Here is Pickman. 

Jack: What?

Austin: That's eight. 

Ali: [quietly] Jesus.

Austin: Wait, that— [mumbles] I just rolled “8.” No, no, that’s wrong.

Jack: Did you just roll an eight? [Ali laughs] 

Austin: That’s weird that you can do that. That’s weird. [Art laughs loudly] Just, you roll eight. How about this one? 

Jack: [laughing quietly] Rolled an eight. [Art and Ali continue laughing] 

Austin: There we go. Five. Five to Pickman, eight to Marn.

Ali: Great. 

Jack: Five. 

Austin: Uh huh. 

Jack: Five what? 

Austin: Distress damage. Uh, Pickman, I'm gonna say that this is…this is gonna continue to be Echo, as it continues to crawl up your legs and into your back and you can— or, above your back. 

Jack: Oh, god, okay.

Austin: Really just like getting into your fur and onto you, like, separating you from the— you feel like your armor, like…in my mind, there's a sort of a, not a psychic connection, but almost a neurological connection between you and the armor, especially now after taking all these moves like Sanguinary Array, and that starts to get fiddled with here. I guess we'll figure out how much when you— [amused sound] good job, Art, roll 100. [Austin and Jack laugh] Especially as you take—

Art: Look how high I rolled. [Jack laughs] 

Austin: Yeah, great. Especially as you, uh…if you take Fallout here. And then Marn. I mean, I think we've kind of already…you know, I actually think that this might be…is this Fortune? To keep it on—

Ali: I was gonna move it to Fortune, 'cause I have a… 

Austin: Okay. You have that move. 

Ali: Yeah, yeah, yeah, that lets me do that. Yeah.

Austin: Yeah. Let's move it to Fortune, then, as…as it's like, it's, you're getting as much as you can out of your supplies to keep this stuff going. And, you know, sometimes you just, you're pushing it a little. You're not running out of supplies, but you're running out of luck, you know?

Ali: Mm-hmm.

Austin: You're like, “Uh, mm, I'm stretching this stuff a little thinner than I should.”

Ali: I keep reaching into my bag and pulling out like another book instead of another bottle—

Austin: Yes. [Art chuckles] 

Ali: And I’m like, [frustrated noise]. 

Austin: Yeah. And you're definitely gonna Fallout here, Marn, huh? ‘Cause I'm looking, and you have 14 Stress. It's impossible to roll under that, or over that. So you're definitely getting a Stress, or a Fallout. The question is what kind.

Ali: If I suffer Fortune Fallout, I roll with Mastery for the remainder of the session! 

Austin: Love that. 

Ali: Er, situation.

Jack: The remainder of the s— oh. 

Ali: Yeah. 

Austin: Yeah, okay. 

Ali: I think we're gonna be in here for a little bit.

Jack: Oh, come on! [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Oh, there's Major Fallout for Pickman, and…

[1:20:00]

Ali: Major Fallout for Marn. 

Austin: All right, we should— uh, before we figure out what these Fallouts are, actually, we should do damage. 

Ali: See what this was worth. 

Austin: Do that— yeah, I mean, almost certainly will be. Unless you really just whiff it. [Ali laughs] 

Jack: Okay, so I'm rolling Brutal. 

Austin: Yeah.

Jack: So that's two D10? 

Austin: That's corr— 

Jack: No, wait, it’s… 

Austin: No, not D10.

Jack: It’s two D8. 

Austin: Yeah, and you roll, you're using—

Jack: Why did I roll 10 before? 

Austin: Because you critted, and crits increase.

Jack: Oh, right, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. So, go ahead.

Jack: My melee gun has Brutal anyway.

Austin: Yes. Give me that roll. 

Jack: Eh, that’s a six.

Austin: All right, that’s a six. Yeah, totally. Pow, the door goes flying open.

Jack: Explodes. 

Austin: And it breaks enough of the wax away that's been, you know, reduced to this kind of brittle flakiness that it can't quickly recover it. For this bright moment, there is a way out of this train station. However, there are two pieces of Fallout to deal with, aren’t there? [Ali laughs] 

Jack: Both Major?

Ali: Mm-hmm. 

Austin: And they're both Major.

Ali: Oh, but we clear— I clear all of my Stress now, right?

Austin: You do clear all your Stress.

Jack: I also clear all of my Stress.

Ali: Fourteen to zero, for free.

Austin: Perfect for both of you, isn't it? Um, from the…from inside of the— and Es, this is really to your attention, as you, uh, as you see the— as you're planning to do this explosives moment, right? From the ticket booth, where there is still some wetness in the wax, little black seeds begin to pour out of the wax and cover the ground around it. You don't know what that means quite yet. I will tell you it's something like a ticking clock, after which you will have to deal with much, much more wax. [Ali laughs] 

Jack: [laughs] Oh.

Ali: Hmm.

Austin: So if you don't deal with this thing in a big permanent way very quickly, that is a…that is a this town has to deal with this, instead of this train station has to deal with this, you know? The second one, and I'll just say it, because Jack, I sent it to you to get approval. [Ali laughs softly] No one else knows this right away, certainly. I guess, in my mind…in my mind, this is something that would be being played close to the chest, Jack, until an opportune moment. Does that make sense?

Jack: Yeah, sure, but we’ll…

Austin: I'll say it.

Jack: Yeah.

Austin: Yeah. Fallout, Possessed: “You are possessed by a ghost, and your body becomes a grim marionette. Until the end of the current situation, you are trapped as a passenger behind your eyes, and the ghost has full control over your actions.” In this case, the ghost in question is, of course, Pastor Alaway. Or no longer Pastor, just the the wax fiend Alaway, the vampire who once promised a night of light and glory, has now gained control, slipping between you and your armor and into your mind itself.

Jack: Oh, god. This is just through the wax through the armor? 

Austin: Yeah. I mean, it's— you're just covered in wax, now. Your whole body from neck down. No one can see it because of the armor, right? But you've been covered by it, and it's kind of gripped into you. 

Jack: Ugh. Can I— 

Austin: And— mm-hmm? 

Jack: Can I add a gross detail?

Austin: Please. [Janine laughs] 

Jack: You know how goats have like rectangular pupils? 

Austin: Yeah.

Jack: What if they fill with wax?

Austin: Ooh, I love that. 

Art: Ugh.

Austin: But it can't be a tell that people can see.

Jack: No, because you're in battle. Pickman is wearing armor.

Austin: Yeah, yeah.

Jack: And, you know, her fur is probably all clogged with wax, and…

Austin: Yes. Yes. But we get the close up of it. 

Jack: Of these, like, goat eyes.

Austin: The close up shot. Yeah, uh huh.

Jack: Black goat eyes filling with wax.

Austin: Uh huh. Great. [Ali laughs] Love it.

Janine: Mm-hmm.

Austin: Good mirror, too, of the other, the wax people eyes of having their wicks and their lights in there, too. 

Jack: Oh, yeah.

Austin: You know? But the door is open, and there’s still— the smoke that was gathering in here begins to billow out into the night outside. I think Rebek, at this moment, does tip her hat to y'all and say:

Austin (as Rebek): All right, everybody out. Let's go. 

Austin: Does not drop guns. Does not, you know, move into a more passive posture. Like, does the thing of like rushing with her people, including Kerr, you know, guns up to kind of cover themselves from being attacked— or, you know, cover that group from being attacked by you. But I'm guessing you're just— you're just out right away, right, Marn? Marn and Bucho and…Pickman?

Ali: Um, I was willing to be on team “help people get out.” I don't know that I could do like an assist roll for NPCs?

Austin: I don't think that— no one here needs that.

Ali: Okay, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.

Austin: Except for Ennib, who is tied up as a hostage still. But Bucho seems to have her by the collar still, so. I think Bucho’s out quick.

Jack: Marn's Fallout was the…the wax seeds?

Ali: Oh, yeah, I wasn’t given a—

Austin: The wax seeds.

Ali: Oh, was that what that was?

Austin: It is these wax seeds, that if you do not kill this thing, it is going to continue to grow in size and scope in a bad way. I know it's not Possession, but Fortune Fallout just isn't the same as Echo Fallout, you know?

Ali: Right, right, right. And I roll with Mastery.

Austin: So yeah. But you're not rolling anything right now, are you? What are you rolling?

Ali: No, I'm just saying I do for the rest of the situation.

Austin: Oh, because you took Fallout.

Ali: Yeah.

Austin: Yes, yes, yes. You just took Fortune Fallout. 

Ali: Uh huh.

Austin: Yes. All right. I think it's bomb time, it sounds like.

Janine: Uh huh.

Austin: Mm.

Art: Let’s do this.

Janine: Well, the great news is I can fly, and I have a lot of bombs, and there's fire. So. 

Austin: That's true. That’s true. [Ali laughs] 

Janine: What more could anyone ask for than this?

Austin: Janine, I'm gonna be a friend and remind you that you could use Crucible if you wanted to. It's a risk, ‘cause you're only at three.

Janine: Yeah…

Austin: But I just want to make sure you know that that's a move you have, that… 

Janine: I'm aware, but it's… 

Austin: Okay. 

Janine: Roll a D6. If it's equal to or under, then clear that, but if it's over, then I take that as Stress.

Austin: Yes. 

Janine: Which seems like not a great deal right now, to me.

Austin: Totally. I just wanted to raise it. I mean, you're at three. You're at the 50/50. You're at the coin flip spot for it, which, totally understand not wanting to take that risk. 

Janine: Yes.

Austin: But wanted to say it into a microphone so that you knew.

Janine: What is there— do I have something that lets me take…what am I…oh, is it Exsanguinate? Yeah, you can mark Stress accrued as a result of using the spell to Echo. 

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Janine: Okay. 

Austin: Yes, yes. 

Janine: Oh, I should have done that.

Art: And, uh, still helping?

Janine: Oh, I did do that before. Uh, yes, right?

Austin: Yeah, I think you're helping, right? What are you— what's that look like? Are you helping to like plant these bombs, basically? 

Art: Uh huh. Using Technology, being like, yep.

Austin: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah. [Janine laughs] And then, and then I would imagine this is— this is Kill, Es? I think this is pretty clearly Kill.

Janine: Yeah, I would say this is Kill. Yeah.

Austin: All right. Wiring this stuff up. It's still Risky. But let's see how it goes, I guess, as everybody else files out of this place as quickly as can be.

Janine: Cover your hinders. [brief pause] Okay.

Austin: That is a seven, one, four, nine, seven. The nine goes away, but the seven is a success at a cost. Let's see what this Stress looks like. Three to Es and two to Duvall. I think this is most fun to be like, is this the bomb going off as you're trying to get out? Right?

Art: Sure.

Janine: I bet it's probably pretty hard to fly when there's a fucking shockwave happening.

Jack: Mm.

Austin: Yeah.

Janine: Physically. 

Austin: Yeah, totally. Totally. Though, I guess with…let me look at what's…what's this shit do? Dynamite: Limited, Spread, Dangerous. What's Dangerous do? I forget what Dangerous does. Uh…okay, that's only if you— let's see what your Stress looks like. What sort of— let’s see what you make, what you do from this. So it's D8, D8, D6, right?

Janine: Yeah.

Austin: I think these are all probably Blood Stress for all of you, which Es, I think that means you just get none, ‘cause your Protection is high enough, right? 

Janine: Mm-hmm.

Austin: And then, Duvall, do you— what— okay, take one. Okay.

Janine: I still roll Fallout, right?

Austin: No, ‘cause you didn't take any.

Janine: Oh, okay. 

Austin: If you don't take Stress, you don't have to roll Fallout.

Janine: Okay. Cool. 

Austin: Protection is very strong. 

Janine: Cool, cool, cool.

Austin: Duvall gets Minor Fallout. [Janine makes sympathetic noise] Buddy. At least it's Minor.

Art: Managed to roll a one. 

Austin: You did manage to do that. I think this is, pretty simply, Battered: “Your dominant hand is injured. You can bandage it up and stop the bleeding, but it's of limited use for the time being. Any offensive action you make in combat becomes Risky. Any attacks that require refined dexterity are out of the question.” I guess it’s less about your hands so much as just general, like…I mean, I guess maybe it's Ringing— maybe Ringing Head is more of the escaping the bomb as it blows up thing, right? [Ali laughs] Let's go with Ringing Head instead. That's kind of more of what I mean. 

Art: Sure.

Austin: Ringing Head is your next roll is Dangerous, the one after that is Risky, and then you can clear it. 

Art: All right.

Austin: I’ve pasted it. So, Es, give me these damage rolls.

Janine: All right! Uh, first dynamite is a five.

Austin: Boom, a five. Okay.

Janine: [disappointed] Second dynamite is a two.

Austin: Uh huh. Seven total. Let’s see.

Janine: The red smoke charge is a five.

Austin: It's a five!

Jack: Whoa!

Austin: That is…that is, to the number, what you needed. [Ali laughs]To the number, what you needed. 

Janine: [laughs victoriously] We’re good. 

Austin: One less would not have done it. So what's this look like? As this train station completely fucking falls apart. You— the two of you get out last, presumably.

Janine: I’m probably gonna take the window up.

Austin: Yeah, you take the window up. Duvall—

Janine: That seems smart. 

[1:30:00]

Austin: Duvall has to run out the door. And then, yeah, as this, the wax begins to come back to life, you know, it gets that moisture again. And you can— you can see it trying to get out the door and spread away, as the bomb begins to tick down. And I guess I’m gonna give you the two things that happen at once is, Es— actually, they don't happen at once. They happen in succession. Es, inside, when you look back inside of that, that center ticket booth, that presence that was there seems gone. And then everything blows up. The train station, you know, erupts into fire. Bricks go everywhere. Glass shatters and goes everywhere. And from your height and positioned above the town, you can see that there is fire spreading through parts of Blackwick, especially southern Blackwick, the part where people's town— or people's houses are and shops and stuff like that. As these wax creatures have begun to just, you know, terrorize all of Blackwick. The deputies are fighting against them. People in the church like Marisha are trying to just like get into safe places and lock the doors. And you see a lot of these people, the wax people, like do the thing where they kind of melt themselves down into hot liquid wax to spread through the street or to cover up a house. Like, they're trying to do the same thing. They're not as…they're not as able to kind of multiply and become increasingly spread out as the creature you just fought. But, you know, it's still bad out there. You don't know what the situation is going to be by the morning, you know? If people don't get involved. I guess meanwhile, outside, we're also back at a showdown of a sort, as Rebek and Lejune—Lejune, I think, is probably more out of it—kind of stare you down. Rebek has her kind of lever action shotgun pointed at the group of you, not up to shoot, but sort of like, you know, kind of a hip, a hip held posture, as if to be like, “All right, I'm still covering you. Like, I'm still not sure about y'all even after all of that.” 

Austin (as Rebek): [sighs] So here we are. [sighs] Based on your actions, I do believe that you were not the cause, at least direct, of whatever the hell just happened in that station. But I also believe you still have my sniper. And I would say it is in both of our interests that you return her to me.

Ali (as Marn): And you'll leave Blackwick?

Austin (as Rebek): [sighs] I could be convinced. But you need to understand what you send us back to. I’m down a brother, who I believe you took from me. We are down a religious leader, a prophet whose words and guidance meant much to many. And we have no justice for that loss, because none here would turn their backs on a murderer. We will return to the Magistratum with those—

Ali (as Marn): Wait. Okay. I'm standing in a burning city full of people that you killed, including their leader. We're fucking even. 

Austin (as Rebek): That's not how it works. 

Ali (as Marn): It is 100 percent how it works.

Austin (as Rebek): You're talking to the wrong person, little Telluricist. It's not how it works. Not with God's chosen. When we go back and we tell them what happened, you ought expect more to come.

Ali (as Marn): We just saved your lives!

Janine (as Es): I have a question.

Austin (as Rebek): My life is nothing next to the Prophet’s.

Ali (as Marn): Take that up with Polyte, not these people.

Austin (as Rebek): I would love to, but someone won't tell me where the hell he is. 

Ali (as Marn): Good luck finding him. 

Austin (as Rebek): I'm sorry, your question, miss. 

Janine (as Es): Yeah, my—

Austin (as Rebek): Y'all didn't even help! You didn't even try! 

Austin: Looks to you, Es. [Ali laughs] 

Janine (as Es): My question is: how many will come if you go back alive versus if you die here? I'm just curious, like, math-wise. [Ali laughs softly] 

Austin (as Rebek): I can't rightly guess. You want to kill me here and take that risk? I don't know.

Janine (as Es): Well, if it's the same number minus you lot, that puts us in a better position. 

Austin (as Rebek): Could be triple.

Janine (as Es): You people are so dramatic. [Ali laughs softly] 

Austin (as Rebek): We live dramatic lives. Fulmina would have us rejoice in that.

Ali (as Marn): You didn't give us much opportunity to help you find him. And I'm not doing that anyway! That's where we're at.

Austin (as Rebek): All right. Give me my sniper back. [Ali laughs]

Janine (as Es): Why? 

Austin (as Rebek): Because I'll kill you if you don't. 

Janine (as Es): [laughs softly] 

Austin (as Rebek): Don't test me. You already took my brother. If I can take one or two of you, that makes us even on a personal level. [brief pause, emphatic] Don't test me.

Jack: I think like Alaway puts his hand on Pickman’s gun, [Austin laughs softly] just like readying it.

Austin: Um…I think she shoots you. 

Jack: Great. 

Austin: The second you make a move like that. [Ali laughs softly] 

Jack: Okay, yeah.

Austin: So what do you— I guess she goes to shoot you. Do you— does Alaway try to move Pickman’s body out the way?

Jack: Uh, what does Alaway…what is the value of being in Pickman’s body for Alaway? 

Austin: Um, that they could hurt the rest of the Blackwick Group. 

Jack: Yeah. 

Austin: And get revenge, right? This would be a minor victory, would be have Pickman die, right? 

Jack: Yeah, Alaway doesn’t really know who Pickman is. 

Austin: A major victory would— 

Jack: It's Es and Marn. 

Austin: Right. You're just another train— right, exactly. 

Jack: I think what—

Austin: But you do feel— to be clear, I think you feel Alaway poking around in memories. I think you feel Alaway…actually, where is Pickman in this moment?

Jack: Oh, Pickman is fully in— I've been thinking about this. Pickman is fully embodied.

Austin: Mm.

Jack: And is looking through wax.

Austin: Ooh. Okay, sure.

Jack: Like when you're…like when you're really ill, and your eyes are like gummy, you know? [laughs softly] 

Austin: Yeah.

Janine: Ugh. 

Jack: I think Pickman is just like fully there and just is unable to…unable to act. I think what Alaway is trying to do by putting his hand on the gun is raise the sta— is, um, like, put the cat among the pigeons. 

Austin: Right, right, right.

Jack: But I think if his goal is get revenge on the Blackwick Group, A, gunfire happening is good, but—

Austin: Yeah.

Jack: Pickman is probably better alive than dead. So I think Alaway is gonna try and take…if she shoots at Pickman—

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Jack: Alaway is gonna try and take evasive maneuvers.

Austin: All right, give me a Evade and…well, it's not Technology anymore, ‘cause you destroyed it. [Ali laughs] Uh, Haven.

Jack: Okay. Does anybody want to help Pickman?

Austin: [chuckles] I will note, at this moment, you probably should, because this is a Spread gun, which means it's going to hit more than Pickman. [Ali and Jack laugh] 

Janine: Um…I have been thinking about a counterattack, but I don't know if that's the help thing, ‘cause that seems like a thing that damage would be attached to.

Austin: Hmm. Yeah. But it could be the sort of thing that's like, are you trying to push her off, you know, off of a stable platform so she misses, right? And maybe you don't get to do the damage, but you still get to use Kill in that way, as like a way of, you know, making her not be able to firm up a shot.

Janine: Yeah.

Ali: Um, I could assist, 'cause I was sort of the person most inv— like, active in this conversation and therefore would like notice this? 

Austin: Sure. What's this— what's helping look like here? 

Ali: But yeah, exactly. [laughs] 

Austin: I mean, it might. I mean, if you have an idea, I'm always open. 

Ali: Um…

Austin: I do think the idea of like trying to knock her off balance is a perfectly fine way to help.

Ali: Right, but is that…is that like standing in front of Pickman or is that like rushing this person?

Austin: I could go— I could— I'm flexible. 

Ali: Okay. [laughs] 

Austin: I don't know that standing in front of Pickman. I think standing in front of Pickman is just taking the shot, you know? 

Ali: Right, right, right, yeah. 

Austin: And also Marn's little, and Pickman’s big, so it would be kind of hard to…

Jack: [laughs] It just goes right over Marn’s head. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Uh huh!

Ali: I guess that's the thing, is like, Marn would be like presumably like the person standing closest to this person that they're yelling at.

Austin: Yeah, yeah.

Ali: And could like do the thing of, like, hitting the gun from the bottom. 

Austin: Right, to try to knock it.

Jack: Oh, like we did with Blick, back in Sapodilla. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Mm-hmm. Yeah.

Ali: We're great at this trick!

Jack: Oh, yeah.

Austin: It’s a great one. All right.

Jack: It's the old Marn and Alaway team. 

Ali: Mm-hmm. [laughs] 

Austin: Uh huh.

Janine: Uh.

Jack: A couple of interesting things here. Pickman doesn't have Evade or Haven. 

Austin: Love it. Great. 

Jack: From behind the wax, Pickman is thinking, “Power up the armor, you idiot.” [Austin laughs] 

[1:40:00]

Janine: Mm. 

Jack: Because she knows that if Alaway takes this shot, her body is at risk.

Austin: Yeah.

Jack: But Alaway has no fucking idea how to use Shape Knight armor, so… [Ali laughs] 

Austin: No. No, not at all. No. Definitely not.

Ali: Has anyone here had sleep paralysis?

Jack: Oh! Yes! This is— yeah.

Ali: It's 100 percent that, right? Where it's like you have the awareness of like wanting to say something, but you can't feel your body move, ‘cause it won't. 

Austin: Uh huh.

Jack: Yeah. Or, you know, Pickman can't work out whether or not she is actually saying it, and she's not.

Ali: Mm-hmm.

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Jack: Oh my god, it sucks. [Ali laughs] Okay, so I'll take plus one.

Austin: Take plus one, and then roll. What are you rolling, two dice? 

Jack: Uh, yeah. 

Austin: ‘Cause you don’t have Evade or Haven? All right, it's Risky. [Ali laughs] 

Jack: Is this Risky? Yeah, I'm fighting a…

Austin: Oh yeah. [Janine groans] You're up against— you're up against a— uh huh. [Ali laughs] 

Jack: I mean, look.

Austin: It's like that.

Jack: I can't say “Play the character honestly when I'm playing Pickman,” and then say, [Austin laughs] “And don't play the character honestly when you're playing a marionette of Pickman.”

Austin: Uh huh.

Janine: Yeah.

Jack: [gasps, delighted] Yes!

Austin: Oh, that's a critical failure. [Ali gasps]

Janine: Oh, cool.

Austin: You take double Stress. [Jack laughs] I don't think we've ever seen this happen. 

Ali: Oh my god.

Austin: Or if we have, I don't know when we last did. Take double Stress! That's a lot of Stress. [Ali laughs] ‘Cause I was gonna be like, it's not that big of a deal, ‘cause Pickman has all this armor, you know? 

Art: Is it two dice or do you roll a dice and double it? 

Austin: I'm trying to figure out what— I probably roll a die and double it, right?

Ali: Do I also take that from the assist? 

Austin: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. 

Ali: Love it. Well, I have zero Stress right now, so… [sighs] 

Austin: Okay, well, here's Pickman.

Ali: Pile it on. 

Austin: So, wait, let's decide. Do we want— do we want two dice or do we want to roll it once and double it?

Jack: Uh, which is better, Art?

Austin: Because the book is not clear.

Jack: For Pickman.

Art: I mean, there's no…there's no telling.

Ali: Yeah. It depends on what the first one is.

Austin: You’d have to roll the die. 

Art: Gonna be a low roll, it's better if you double it. 

Ali: Let's just…

Austin: Uh huh.

Janine: It does say “take double Stress” and not “take Stress twice.”

Ali: Yeah.

Austin: That's true. That's true. All right, let's double it. Here is Pickman.

Janine: Sorry if that’s bad, if that— 

Austin: Hey! Pickman only gets two. [Janine and Jack laugh excitedly]

Art: Hey! [someone applauds]

Austin: And Marn gets 12 Blood Stress.

Ali: Love it. Love it for me.

Janine: Fuck.

Jack: Wait. Oh no. You don't even get the Get— I can't even give you the Get Behind Me stuff, [Ali laughs] because it's Alaway. 

Austin: Why?

Jack: 'Cause it's Alaway! 

Austin: Oh, it's Alaway. Yeah, yeah. Yeah.

Jack: An ally within your arm's reach of you gains plus one Blood Protection. 

Austin: Yeah. Also, Alaway—

Jack: Marn is not my ally.

Austin: Also, Alaway knows Marn. This is almost the ideal situation for Alaway.

Ali: Mm-hmm.

Austin: Marn fucked up Alaway’s whole shit. [Ali laughs] Right? So like, why would the Alaway try to get in front of Marn to take this hit?

Jack: Yeah, big waxy grin from Pickman as…

Austin: Uh huh. As Pickman takes no damage from this shot.

Jack: Wait, no, I take…oh, yeah, 'cause it’s my Blood, right?

Austin: Two. Your Blood Protection’s five. [Ali laughs] 

Jack: Completely swallows. [laughs softly] 

Austin: Uh huh. And Marn takes ten. 

Ali: Yeah. 

Jack: No!

Ali: Two Blood Protection there. 

Janine: Mm.

Ali: This is— okay, you know what this is? [laughs] 

Austin: Uh huh?

Ali: You know that guy who makes those videos where it's like, [mocking] “If someone's pointing a gun at you, you just move your shoulder into— [laughs loudly] 

Austin: [crosstalk] Yes. Yes! [someone applauds]

Jack: Yes! [Janine laughs]

Austin: [laughs] Oh my god.

Jack: (??? 1:43:00)

Ali: [continues laughing] This is Marn being like, “Oh, I know. I'm just gonna grab this gun as this person’s shooting it and like point it higher, ‘cause I watched the tutorial.”

Austin: [crosstalk] Uh huh. Uh huh.

Ali: And fucking, [laughs softly] it's the TikTok of the guy suddenly being in heaven and being like, “Oh, shit.”

Jack: Yes!

Austin: Uh huh. I'm not hitting Es with this, because Es is flying, presumably. 

Janine: Mm-hmm.

Austin: But Duvall, are you standing near them? Because this is a Spread gun. This is— if you're standing near them, you also get shot by this. 

Art: Yeah, I guess so. 

Austin: All right. Duvall, take eight Blood.

Art: Wait, why is it doubled for me? 

Austin: ‘Cause it was a critical failure. I guess—

Art: I didn’t try to evade a damn thing.

Austin: You know what? Fair. You're right, you're right. [Austin and Ali laugh] You just took it regular, as…

Art: I didn’t Evade or assist. [Austin, Ali, and Janine laugh] 

Austin: All right, take the four. Go ahead, you take four. And then I’m gonna need Fallout tests for those of you…

Ali: That’s another Major Fallout.

Jack: No! 

Austin: There's Major Blood Fallout. There you go, Marn.

Ali: Of course it was. Are you kidding me? [laughs] 

Janine: Oh my god.

Austin: How was it not gonna be? [Ali laughs] No Fallout from Pickman. 

Art: Wait, wait. That’s— 

Austin: Oh, Pickman didn’t need— 

Art: That roll’s wrong. 

Austin: Pickman didn't need any Fallout. Pickman didn't take any damage. 

Jack: I just wanted to roll it. I just wanted to roll it anyway.

Ali: Sure. [laughs] 

Austin: Uh huh.

Jack: To be smug. [laughs softly] 

Ali: A sympathy… [laughs softly] 

Janine: Mm.

Austin: And Duvall gets Minor. 

Art: Another one. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Uh huh. Another one. Another one. Unbelievable.

Art: But I keep clearing that Blood Stress. 

Austin: Oh, that's true. Yeah, yeah.

Ali: Oh, that's right. I have no more Blood Stress.

Jack: Remember when we…

Ali: I’m just gonna (??? 1:44:22).

Jack: This was a two-way standoff, and then it became a three-way standoff.

Austin: Uh huh. 

Jack: And the Blackwick Group now thinks they've gone back to a two-way standoff, [Ali laughs] but it’s actually a secret three-way standoff again.

Austin: Yeah. Uh huh. 

Janine: Oh, man.

Austin: Right, it is another one. It is, because of Alaway. That’s very funny.

Jack: This is just the Gren situation again.

Austin: It is just the Gren. [laughs] Yes. The Grent was there!

Jack: [laughing] The Grent!

Austin: [thinking noise] Marn, you're Downed. “You can't move under your own power, and you're barely clinging onto consciousness. You can be moved around by others, but without medical attention, you're not going anywhere. Can be upgraded to Dying.”

Ali: Sure. 

Austin: There's no way it's anything but that with ten.

Ali: Yeah. [laughs]  

Austin: There's just— I mean, it is what it is, right? Talk shit, get hit.

Ali: Uh huh. 

Austin: And then, Duvall…you don't bleed anymore, do you? 

Art: Well, we were just talking about that, weren't we?

Austin: Oh, we were! We were just talking about that.

Art: Maybe. 

Austin: The answer is maybe, so I'm gonna say yes. You are Bleeding: “At the end of each situation where you have this Fallout, mark D4 Stress to Blood. Ongoing.” Es is the one who doesn't bleed anymore. And speaking of Es, it sounded like Es had an attack that she wanted to make.

Janine: Well, now I'm torn. 

Austin: Yeah? 

Janine: I was absolutely gonna try and shoot her in the head with my new gun. 

Ali: Mm.

Austin: Mm, sure.

Jack: Oh, yeah, 'cause you got five of those bullets. Just spend them all on the Magistrate. 

Austin: You sure do.

Janine: Yeah, but also now like everyone's dying, and I kinda don't know…like, does hurting her end the fight? Is the smarter choice to be like, “Get the fuck out of here now. I'll release your sniper, and you can meet wherever, but we— just fucking go”?

Austin: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

Janine:  Like…

Austin: Yeah, maybe.

Janine: I don't know what the… [sighs] I mean, part of…this is also the conflict between the strategic brain and the character brain, because—

Austin: Well, let’s lead with character. What's Es— seeing her friends hurt like this, in a flash, what do we think Es does?

Janine: My— I mean, my true and honest reaction is that like the second that that gun is fired is she gets ready to fire herself.

Austin: Mm-hmm. 

Janine: To shoot her gun.

Austin: Yeah. 

Janine: Like, she doesn't have a lot of…you know, I'm not saying she would go and kill that sniper lady or whatever out of vengeance or anything.

Austin: No.

Janine: But I think in this moment it's very much just like, if that's what we're doing, that's what we're doing. 

Austin: Uh huh. 

Janine: She's in that mode. Like, she's…

Austin: Yep.

Janine: That's been her day.

Austin: Yeah, totally. Totally. We've seen this person who like, you know, 36 hours ago or whatever was like lounging on the boat having a good one, [Janine sighs] be pushed increasingly, increasingly towards this other part of who they are.

Janine: Mm-hmm.

Austin: And that version of them is the part that is like extremely violent and extremely willing to get her hands dirty, right? So. 

Janine: Is this really still a Haven? ‘Cause it seems pretty fucked up. 

Austin: It’s a Haven, yeah. [Ali laughs] 

Janine: Okay…

Austin: The town, Blackwick is Haven, you know? 

Janine: Yeah, yeah. 

Austin: So, whereas just the station had Technology. The closest it would get to not being would be like, if things keep going this way, it'll get to be Desolate, you know?

Janine: Right. 

Austin: If the wax creatures overdo it. But it's not Cursed, and it's not Occult. Cursed is about…is about Course-touched stuff for us, and Occult is about like literal occult things, so.

Janine:  Anyone want to yell “boo” really loud and help me with the… [Janine and Austin laugh softly] 

Austin: This would be Duvall, right? Duvall is still, did not…didn't do much. 

Art: That's what you're looking for, is boo? What’s…

Janine: [laughs] I don't know, something. I don't know, anything to get me an extra die here to maybe have a shot here.

Austin: I will say that the thing that makes this— I will say that your shot with this gun does not need to be Risky, because it has Ranged on her rifle.

Janine: Ooh, okay. 

Austin: Right? That's the thing. It's Extreme Range. She's only Ranged. She's one of the best, you know, marksmen we've seen on screen ever, second to maybe her own sniper. But I will give you that here. I think that that counts. No Mastery, though, right? This thing doesn't give you Mastery.

Janine: I mean, I'm flying. 

Austin: What’s that—

Austin: I'm still eyeball. I still get Mastery on Kill.

Austin: Oh, you get Mastery on Kill. Right, right, right. 

Janine: On Hunt and Kill.

Austin: Yes, on Hunt and Kill. Yeah. So yeah, that counts. All right.

Janine: Ohh, come on.

Austin: Mm-hmm. Eight! Take no Stress.

Janine: Eight! Yeah, okay. 

Austin: Give me your damage. It's good damage, right? It's like super good damage on that gun.

Janine: D12. 

Ali: Yeah.

Austin: D12. 

Janine: Five shots at D12.

Austin: Five shots. Don't miss. You didn’t miss this one.

Janine: Eleven.

Austin: Oh, did it go through? 

Ali: Yeah.

Janine: I got an eleven.

Austin: It did. There it is, eleven.

Janine: Yeah. 

Austin: Boom. All right. Um, she drops to one knee and like, you know, probably drops the gun to her side and begins to cough, cough up blood. [Janine sighs] At which point—

Janine: It’s a real play stupid games win stupid prizes. [Ali laughs softly] 

Austin: Yeah, uh huh. At this point, it's clear that the priest is trying to make a decision about whether she should be trying to help her boss and her friend Rebek or whether she is also going to continue this…this kind of, I don't want to say a cycle of violence, but this back and forth, right? This, um… 

Ali: Standoff. 

Austin: It’s more than a standoff, now. It's a…what do you call it when two people stand across from each other and start pun— like, slugfest, you know? It's just, you're just going for it at this point. And I think you see her begin to pull out one of these prayer cards. And I think we see Kerr just like cover her eyes, because she's like, “Oh my god, this is going as bad as it could possibly go.” Uh, how's Alaway? What’s Alaway up to?

[1:50:16]

Jack: I mean, I did type “Alaway kidnap Marn” in the chat, and I don't know how we feel about this. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Oh, I didn't see that. I didn’t see that.

Jack: I mean, Marn is down.

Austin: Oh my god. 

Jack: And—

Austin: Marn is down.

Jack: And, uh…you know, might be time to offer some help.

Austin: Oh, sure.

Ali: Yeah, um…

Jack: I don't know. How do you feel about this, Ali?

Ali: I've certainly upset a nearby figure in a… [laughs] 

Austin: Ah, yes.

Ali: This or a nearby Haven, so. 

Austin: Mm. 

Ali: That's so funny. Pickman being like, “Oh, I gotta go save Marn.” [laughs softly] 

Jack: It depends how you want this to go for Marn, right? 

Austin: Is that what happens? Yeah, does…

Ali: “Be right back, everybody.” [Ali and Jack laugh] Um, yeah, I mean, Marn is pretty much out of the scene, right? Like, I could…I…

Austin: I think what Jack is signaling is like, is this a narrative space that you're interested or comfortable with?

Ali: Sure. 

Austin: In terms of being kidnapped.

Ali: Um, yeah, I think that would be fine. I think that we would have to…this would be a secondary conversation with, like, what is step two? 

Austin: Yeah. Yeah.

Jack: Yes. 

Ali: Setting up some— 

Jack: ‘Cause I can cause— [both pause]

Austin: Go ahead. 

Jack: Cause trouble in other ways. 

Ali: No, just like— yeah. 

Austin: Right. I'm not saying that this should happen, right? [Ali laughs] But why does Alaway not just kill Marn right now?

Jack: Um, that's a good— that is a good question. I mean, I think the answer is because we're making…we're making the show. But that speaks to what we're doing more than Ala—

Austin: Yes. But that’s… 

Jack: Like, there is no…

Austin: Yeah, mm-hmm. 

Jack: Good storytelling in this moment isn't Alaway just kills Marn. So, I mean, what is his…is it just that the revenge is— I was— I've been trying to figure out like… [laughs softly] I was looking up Alaway’s motivations, so I went to the excellent Search at the Table and tried to find Alaway dialogue.

Austin: [crosstalk] Mm-hmm. Ah, sure, yes. Mm-hmm.

Jack: Do you know how much Alaway speaks, Austin? 

Austin: Very little. Like, twice.

Ali: Uh huh.

Jack: Alaway has said four lines. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Mm, mm-hmm.

Jack: And I will read them all out now. 

Austin: Please.

Jack: These four lines are what has been guiding my stupid Alaway. [Austin laughs softly] Line one, Austin as Alaway: “You've done well.” Line two, Austin as Alaway: “Get them!” [laughs softly] 

Ali: Mm, mm-hmm. [Austin laughs] 

Jack: Line three, Austin as Alaway: “You don't get it.” Line four, and this is the one that I feel gives us the most to work with.

Austin: Yeah.

Jack: “Oh, an uncivilized beast in my place of power. We'll see.” [laughs softly] And that's to Es, who's trying to attack him. 

Austin: There's more than that. There is more than that, ‘cause you also should search for Gala who plays— who Alaway begins to inhabit at the end.

Jack: Oh, that’s absolutely true, yeah! 

Austin: Other things Alaway has said: “I told you, you can't kill me. They're all me when I want them to be. That's the trick. Your vampire friend back there, she wants to extend the life of her body. Give up on the body, and it becomes much easier.” And then—

Jack: “The world of light will come.”

Austin: Yep, “The world of light will come. You can't stop this,” and “I will find you.” 

Ali: Sure.

Jack: I mean, you know, as good a reason as any is the revenge could be bigger. 

Austin: Yeah, the revenge could be bigger.

Jack: Just killing Marn right now, better to engineer a situation.

Austin: Maybe it’s that, yeah—

Ali: It’s the, yeah.

Austin: Marn’s already dying. Why do I need to waste, why do I need to pull the mask off to kill someone who's already bleeding out on the ground? 

Ali: Right.

Austin: Right?

Ali: It’s Among Us. [laughs] 

Austin: It’s Among Us. It’s Among Us.

Jack: But a good move in Among Us, right, is you come with me.

Ali: Uh huh. 

Jack: We can…

Austin: Yes, sure. Yeah.

Ali: Yeah.

Austin: Sure. So yeah, does Pickman just…in the brief moment.

Jack: I think Pickman says— I think Pickman says:

Jack (as Alaway/Pickman): [unusual voice] Let's get you to safety, Marn. [Ali and Austin laugh softly] 

Ali: Can I…okay. Barring being like, this can happen just fine and it's fine. 

Austin: Uh huh.

Ali: Could Bucho come with? Or Alekest at least?

Jack: Oh, Bucho can come with.

Austin: Yeah, the Alekest— yeah, I think both of them, for sure, should come with.

Jack: Abso— Bucho’s so welcome to come with. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Yeah, uh huh. 

Jack: I'm not done with him yet.

Austin: Bucho— I want to reiterate that Bucho is like in a bad place right now.

Jack: Yeah.

Austin: Because of the closeness to all the wax again.

Ali: Mm-hmm. 

Austin: This is like a real point of displeasure and discomfort and trauma for Bucho that like we shouldn't forget in this moment, that Bucho has now like done his best to be tough about this to help his friends in this moment, and it's very hard for him. 

Jack: Yeah.

Austin: But yes, I think when Marn drops, Bucho's reaction is to drop his weapon and help pick Marn up with Pickman.

Ali: Oh, this is so good! [laughs] 

Austin: Uh huh.

Ali: I was thinking, like, one of them can come with 'cause there would be some accountability there, and that sort of protects Marn. But it's also just the movie theater thing of being like, I know that Alaway’s fucking in there, and to have Alaway alone with Bucho again is like—

Austin: Uh huh. Uh huh.

Ali: [as if watching a movie] Bucho, don’t open that door! [laughs] 

Jack: Yeah.

Austin: A hundred percent. 

Jack: Yeah.

Austin: Yep. I think, at this point, Alekest puts a hand on Pickman’s, you know, shoulder and says, you know:

Austin (as Alekest): Go ahead. We'll catch up.

Jack: Big nod, waxy nod from Pickman. 

Austin: Uh huh. [laughs softly] 

Jack: I say waxy nod in the sense of movement, but…

Art: What makes a nod waxy? [Ali laughs] 

Jack: Pickman is covered in wax. 

Austin: Oh, okay. 

Jack: Just—

Austin: A waxy nod.

Jack: You know. It’s— her fur is clogged, and it's all like, it's flaking off her horns.

Austin: Ick. And, uh…

Jack: Yeah, I'm gonna—

Austin: And…

Jack: Let’s— you want to make for like a house or like an abandoned building or something?

Austin: Yeah, I guess that makes sense. An abandoned building makes sense to me, right? Maybe the town council, maybe— what's the most cool dramatic place?

Jack: Temple of Slumbous? There’s lots of candles? 

Austin: Yeah, but that's not…but that's not their place of power, you know what I mean? Maybe…god, has it been? Has it become a place— have they been going to the temple of the Boundless Conclave and like replacing all the candles?

Jack: Look, every candle in Sangfielle is made by five hands, so. [Ali laughs] 

Austin: Ah. That's true. That is simply true, isn't it? 

Jack: That’s gotta include…

Austin: Uh huh.

Jack: Maybe that’s how it got in. 

Austin: I mean, that was part of it, right? That is— I mean, yes, that is a big part of how people got in. That is 100 per— you've seen through the scheme.

Ali: Uh huh.

Austin: Very easy to get in when you ship all of the candles across all of Sangfielle, to make some special ones that wind up in Blackwick.

Jack: God, it's so gross. The flashback to the vat starting to work.

Austin: Yep.

Jack: The factory starting to work.

Austin: Uh huh.

Jack: Alaway being poured out of the vat. 

Austin: Well, and Alaway…the big thing here is that I think Alaway made a important discovery or decision in response to all of this. Or not the important thing, but one thing that's worth just saying, especially now that we know that we have some, you know, we have Alaway’s interiority because, Jack, you're playing Alaway now. What Jack— or what Al— not Jack. [Ali laughs] What Alaway realized was, as I said earlier, when I was like, Gala says that I'm all of them. What Alaway realized was like, oh, I should have— I should have actually been all of them, at all times. I should not have given them any autonomy. I should not have had this notion that I'm one of them, and the rest are waiting, are like hosts waiting for me. I should have just always extended my consciousness to all of them at all times. Whatever— whatever I gained by having an autonomous village and the front of it being a church and all of that other stuff, it was lost in having one of them turn against me and try to get her mother back, and that led to this whole group coming to save the day and all that. And so, and so instead, we get this version of it, right? Which is both Alaway’s able to project, you know, consciousness into a person like you, but also you get this thing that's like a little bit less, is on that creature line, like the big, like what Gren became, which is like, is that Alaway? Like, yes and no. Alaway’s in there, but also, it's more flexible than that, right? These other types of being. So yeah, you know, there you go. [Ali laughs softly] I think, at this point, we're back to effectively standoff status. Lejune, the priest, does not…she does not have the same, you know, killer spirit, that the rest of the crew did, certainly not as much as Rebek did. And I think she says:

Austin (as Lejune): All right, all right, all right. Let Ennib go, and we're done. 

Austin: Holding out a prayer card like it's a bomb, you know?

Janine (as Es): I was about to suggest something similar.

Austin: Do you say that in character, or is that Janine speaking?

Janine: Um, I think I say that in character. 

Austin: Okay. 

Janine (as Es): Take your people, and…

Austin (as Lejune): And you take yours. And we're done.

Janine (as Es): I wish. You've told me your…you lot have told me yourselves that we're not done, because you're shameless and fools, but we'll be done for today.

Austin: Kerr is like:

Austin (as Kerr): [hushed] Don’t go down this road again! [Ali, Jack, and Austin laugh] 

Austin: Lightning is also Extreme Range.

Janine: But Es is just like— I know. I know. I want to be clear that Es isn't saying this like in an angry way.

Austin: Uh huh.

Janine: But like, Es is up in the air. 

Austin: Uh huh.

Janine: She has a very good vantage point of how fucked up this town she likes is. 

Austin: Yeah, mm-hmm.

Janine: Under their watch.

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Janine: And they think so highly of themselves. Like…

Austin: They are the arm of justice. [Janine sighs] 

Janine (as Es): Leave. Take your people. I’ll let your sniper go. If I don't let her go, then you can come back and kill me or whatever, but I'll let her go. So leave.

Austin (as Lejune): [hesitates] You gotta let her go now.

Janine (as Es): [frustrated sigh] The problem is I can’t— okay, well…I have to go get her, and I don't want to leave you here with— 

Austin: No, she's here. She's here.

Janine: Okay. Is she? Okay. I thought she was still— 

Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Janine: Okay. I wasn't sure, 'cause you said that thing about the person was like, “You have to bring our person to us,” and I was like, did we leave her in the tree?

[2:00:03]

Austin: Oh, no, she's— she was between Marn and Bucho and them, right? 

Ali: Yeah. 

Austin: And we had that whole picture of her there.

Janine: Okay. Okay. 

Austin: We talked about how it'd be a cooler picture for her to be there, I believe. Unless I'm misremembering, Ali.

Ali: I think she was there. I think the point of the…

Janine: I think that's true.

Austin: Yeah.

Ali: The point of the meetup was having her tied up was a like…

Austin: Yes.

Ali: Yeah, it was both leverage—

Janine: Yeah, yeah. 

Ali: And also being like, “We already got one of your people, so fucking…”

Austin: Yes.

Janine: Yeah, yeah. It was just a line earlier in this session where I was like—

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Janine: —oh, maybe she isn't actually here and I wasn’t remembering that right.

Austin: Yeah. Yeah, I gotcha. Yep, yeah. Yeah, so she's here. Duvall, I think, is probably closest to her at this point.

Janine: Yeah.

Austin: Duvall and Alekest.

Janine: I think Es like looks at at those two, and, you know.

Austin: Yeah.

Janine: It's not like she has a rifle, just, you know.

Austin: Uh huh. I think Lejune says, like:

Austin (as Lejune): Then leave. Just leave. 

Austin: And lays out Rebek on the ground to try to begin— and I think Kerr begins to try to attend to, uh, to Rebek at this moment. And Lejune goes over to where Ennib is, holding up this prayer card the whole time to like kind of, again, as if it's a thermal detonator, you know, as if it's a grenade that could go off at any moment. And, and helps Ennib up, and, you know, to walk over, hand still tied, but to their little group. But, you know, they're gonna attend to each other here. They're not gonna— they're not— I don't think Rebek is in a place where she can get up and leave easily, you know? So I think that she's being attended to right here. Which leaves Duvall and Es and Alekest in this scene. I think Alekest is like:

Austin (as Alekest): Where do you think…where do you think Pickman went with Marn and Bucho? [brief pause] I’m Alekest, by the way. [awkwardly] We met on the boat.

Ali: [laughs] Aw.

Jack: Aw.

Art (as Duvall): Mm. Yeah, yeah. Um…I honestly don't know. 

Art: Like, thinking of like, well where, like we have…

Art (as Duvall): We could check the office? [Austin laughs softly] 

Art: I mean, the office would make the most sense, right? That's, that’s… 

Austin: Yeah. Uh huh. 

Art: Yeah.

Austin: Yeah.

Ali: [quietly] Dun dun dun.

Austin: Yeah, what do we…what happens here?

Janine: I mean, did I…I mean, did I see a direction? 

Austin: Yeah, they went south. Yeah. They went towards—

Janine: Okay. Okay.

Austin: They went down towards the office and the Boundless Conclave, and also coincidentally Polyte’s house. [Ali and Jack laugh] Also down in that general area, coincidentally. 

Ali: Oh, if we see him again, we're gonna be like, man!

Austin: Mm-hmm. Um…what happens? Where are we at? I mean, Marn is knocked out. [laughs softly] I think we have to kind of stay with the Es-Duvall-Alekest group at this point.

Art: Yeah, I guess we sort of have to—

Janine: Mm.

Art: We have to go to the office and…

Austin: It's— this is— you can get there, but it's— the town is not in a good place, as Es has pointed out. I don't…you could talk me in— let's talk about things in a broad picture, instead of individual actions. Do y'all have anything like a plan to bring peace back to this…not peace, but safety back to this town overnight? Or is it—

Art: Overnight? No. I do not have…

Austin: Or is this a fire that's gonna have to burn itself out?

Janine: [sighs] I don’t—

Art: I don't have any kind of plan. [Austin laughs softly] End of sentence. 

Jack: Ha!

Austin: Okay.

Janine: Yeah, I… [sighs] The problem with the wax people is it really does feel like, “Well, what the fuck do you do?” kind of thing, like… [laughs] 

Austin: Yeah.

Janine: This…to some extent, this feels like a pick up the town and move five miles down the road situation. [Ali laughs] 

Jack: God, which is kind of exactly what our— that was one of the plans we floated back in the mansion, right?

Austin: Was it? I don’t remember, but I believe you.

Jack: Uh, it was the just leave, abandon Blackwick.

Ali: Mm.

Austin: Ah, I see. Yeah, sure. Yes.

Art: So much work to have done to then just do that, though. 

Jack: Yeah.

Ali: To zoom out a little bit, I wonder if like we should kind of consider this arc closed, and then when people come back…

Austin: Right.

Jack: Oh. 

Austin: We come in on the other three.

Ali: The full party thing is: what do we do about wax people in Blackwick? 

Austin: Yeah. 

Ali: Or Blackwick recovery.

Jack: ‘Cause as far as the party knows, the wax people are sort of— oh, no, Es has a weird clue, right? That the presence moved.

Austin: Sort of, yeah. I— yes, that is a weird clue that like… [sighs] it could—

Janine: It withdrew.

Austin: Yes, but, but I think there's still enough question marks and especially with Es who understands that consciousness can be this very flexi thing when you talk about the supernatural, right? It's hard to say. I do think that as this happens, we maybe…maybe we do see— eh, I guess it depends on…it depends on how this night goes, right? Like, I will say out loud that part of my original thought about this was to come in after something like this had happened and it to be a Yojimbo situation where like half the town is weird candle people and the other half are deputies of this terrible Magistrate group. And they've kind of split into gangs, and, you know, regular folks are caught in the middle in a bad way. Which is kind of where it's headed, except there isn't— the Magistrates are gonna leave, you know? And you just have these people who've radicalized themselves around Fulmina without any of the sort of, you know…you're right, to be a hundred percent clear, on the morality scale, about what the Magistrates did here being wildly out of scale with what happened to them. But they have a particular code of conduct that they stick to. It's a code of conduct that gets lots of people hurt, but it is that code of conduct, and it is that, like, there's an objective, and they work towards that objective in certain ways. The fucking deputies here are the sorts of people who are like, “Hell yeah, I want to be deputized by the fucking US Marshals. I can't wait to get a badge and a gun,” you know? Those aren't— those people are like the worst of the worst. They want power. And so there is a degree of like, this town is getting split into some weird…getting cut into some weird shapes, some weird pie shapes here. But yeah, maybe we zoom out here, and we could call it here, but I feel like we need a resting breath for the other half of this group, right? Is it as simple as getting back to the…uh, the HQ, that kind of storefront, and realizing that Marn and Bucho and Pickman aren't there?

Art: I would really love to make another roll.

Austin: Sure. Why?

Art: Just because, um… [Austin laughs softly] I want to start clearing this Ringing Head.

Austin: Ah, sure. Gotcha. We could make a roll for you to get across town. I was trying to be nice by not making do that [Ali laughs] and by saying like, you live here. But I actually do think a Delve roll to get across town back to the Blackwick Group headquarters is not the worst of ideas. 

Jack: Oh, yeah. 

Austin: As this town devolves into an open war between these factions.

Ali: And also just like wax people and active fires, and like, it's basically Raccoon City at this point, like. [laughs softly] 

Austin: Yeah, yeah. [Janine laughs] This is, Ali, a hundred percent.

Ali: Yeah. Just like…

Austin: This is Raccoon City. It’s Racoon City meets Yojimbo. It's great. [Ali laughs] I love it. Can't wait to option this.

Ali: Just like bodies stumbling through the town.

Austin: A hundred percent. And half the time you're like, is that a— is that a wax person? Or is that just a person who is distraught and dazed because of how bad everything got? 

Jack: Yeah.

Austin: You know?

Jack: Someone just standing up in the window of a building, looking out.

Austin: Mm-hmm.

Jack: And it’s like, are they wax, or are they…?

Austin: Mm-hmm. Yeah. So yeah, let's call that a Delve roll. That Duvall and Es could do. Or, I guess, Duvall, you want to take the lead so you can start to drop from Dangerous, huh?

Art: Yeah. Um, and I'm going to just say it's a six. [Jack laughs] 

Austin: Ah. That's a smart idea.  [Ali and Janine laugh] Look at you. Look at you. Wise. Which gives you some Stress though, correct? 

Art: Yeah, it’s a six.

Austin: It's a mixed success, right? Yeah, so.

Art: Yeah. Succeed but take Stress. Oh, I also take D4 Stress—

Austin: Oh.

Art: —from the end of the situation, ‘cause of Bleeding.

Austin: Oh my god. Yeah, that was the end of a situation. Well, okay. Well, here's— let me do your D4. Here's your two Blood Stress. So you take one and give me a Fallout test on that.

Art: Okay. It's only one, ‘cause I still have the Protection, right? That’s…

Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. So you'll roll against three. Take—

Art: [loudly outraged] Are you fucking kidding me? Are you fucking kidding me.  Am I being fucking kidded? [Austin, Jack, and Ali laugh]

Austin: Duvall rolled a one. Duvall rolled a one, again?

Art: That's my third one in a row. I'm really unhappy about it. 

Austin: Fascination: luck, everybody.

Ali: I feel so bad for Jess. [Ali and Jack laugh] Just being like, what’s going on with Art in there?

Austin: Oh my god. [Ali laughs] 

Janine: She knows. 

Art: Oh my god.

Austin: Ahh. I would love to give you Furious: “You're hurt, short tempered, and perceive slights everywhere. You cannot help—” [Ali laughs] 

Art: I am! That’s happened. But it’s— it’d be hard to bring this back for next session.

Austin: I know.

Art: It’s gonna be hard for me to keep this.

Austin: It's gonna be different. Yes. It's gonna be diff— it’s gonna be difficult. I think, instead, we should give you, uh…god. I think we just give you Winded here, which is when you attack with melee weapons, which I'm going to say includes your hand, your Annihilation hand.

Art: Yeah.

Austin: It decreases Stress inflicted by one dice size. And I actually like it—

Art: Great.

[2:10:00]

Austin: I actually like it a lot for this, because it's not just that you're winded, it's that like, that, you know, the way that that works, we've talked about, is that you also get annihilated, it's just that your bugs like repair you more quickly, right? 

Art: Yeah.

Austin: What if they couldn't? What if they didn't have it in them to repair you that quickly, right? 

Art: Bugs sleepy. 

Austin: Bugs sleepy! [Janine laughs softly] And so, yeah, when you attack with melee weapons, decrease Stress inflicted by one dice size. ‘Cause they just can't— they have to— they have to scale back how hard they're hitting, in order to keep up with keeping you repaired from using Annihilation, right? 

Art: Yeah. 

Austin: And then also, similarly, if you're using your hive tool or whatever. 

Art: Yeah.

Austin: However, now, Art, you need to take five from—

Art: Yeah, great, uh huh. 

Austin: And that's Fortune, as you try to sneak through this town.

Art: Okay.

Austin: And then give me a Fortune check. This can't possibly be a one. If it's a one, we have to retire the character. [Ali laughs] The jersey has to go up in the rafters. 

Art: Mm. [starts cracking up]

Jack: He just rolled a one. [Art laughs loudly]

Austin: Art, I'm so sorry. I don’t understand how it happened. [Art, Austin, Ali, and Jack laugh]

Janine: Art, can you just— can you just do like a, just a loose, free, just like a D6 roll, just like for fun? Just like, not for anything, just…

Ali: Yeah, just refresh Roll20 really quick. [laughs] 

Austin: Yeah, you just gotta get it out of the system. 

Janine: We just gotta…I just need to see.

Austin: Art, give me a roll D100 real quick. [Ali laughs] But for real.

Jack: He rolled a 72.

Janine: Okay, well.

Austin: All right, that’s a 72. That seems fun. 

Ali: Okay, yeah, you know?

Austin: That seems fine. That seems fine. 

Art: Well, maybe it’s just the twelves. Hold on. 

Austin: Maybe it’s the twelve. That's a five. That’s a five.

Ali: This is (??? 2:11:29)

Art: I’m just gonna do another Fallout test. You know, just for nothing.

Austin: Just for fun, just to see. 

Art: Yeah, this is a nothing—

Austin: Maybe Fallout is broken. 

Ali: That’s two ones!

Austin: That’s an eleven! That would’ve been great. [Jack and Ali laugh] 

Janine: Wow. 

Art: Two ones. 

Austin: It’s still two ones, though, isn't it? 

Janine: Wow. 

Austin: It's two ones, though, isn’t it? 

Jack: Ahh. [Ali sighs and laughs]

Austin: Um, hey, I know what you got here, Art. I'm gonna put this in chat. I think this…yeah, uh huh. I think you take the Minor Fortune Fallout Unlucky: [laughs] “Things are going to get worse before they get better. [Janine makes dismayed noise] You cannot use Fortune Protection.”

Art: Well, lucky for me, I am Thrice-Warded. 

Austin: Oh.

Art: So, “the first time you would take a Minor Fortune Fallout, avoid the Fallout and do not remove Stress from Fortune.”

Austin: All right, well, then you just hold on to that seven Fortune Stress then, bud.

Art: Yeah, that's gonna be great. I'm gonna be fine. [Janine, Jack, and Austin laugh softly] 

Austin: However, that was a success, fundamentally. You did get across the town successfully, right?

Art: Yes, yeah, it was a six.

Austin: [sighs] Unbelievable. And then, yeah, so yeah, you get— you do get to, uh, to the Blackwick Group HQ. You're able to dip in safely. [laughs softly] And, uh, and find that none of your friends are here except for Es and Alekest.

Jack: Wrong house, cowards. [Austin laughs] 

Art: Going back to the damage roll from the, uh…

Austin: Mm-hmm?

Art: Annihilation. 

Austin: Yeah.

Art: That was five ones in a row. 

Austin: [hushed] Wow.

Jack: Wow! That's amazing. That's really good.

Austin: It could be six. We haven't done another roll yet. You know? [Ali laughs] 

Art: Sure, yeah.

Austin: We don’t know.

Art: I did the three practice rolls, but those don't count. [Janine laughs] 

Austin: Yeah. 

Art: The rolls just assure that Roll20 wasn’t broken.

Ali: Uh huh.

Austin: [laughs] Yes. Unbelievable! Unbelievable.

Art: And if anyone out there is doing the math, it was a ten and then four twelves. [Austin and Jack laugh] So it's twelve to the fourth power. 

Austin: Uh huh. 

Art: Times ten.

Austin: Fantastic. Um, I think we probably call it here. Are there any final images of this group?

Art: Just bleeding Duvall pushing open the door to the thing with Es, and it's empty instead of not empty.

Austin: It's empty instead of your fr— yeah, uh huh. It's empty, and it's— here's the fun thing. You're the first people to be in there in like, a long—

Jack: Oh, wow.

Austin: Weeks and weeks and weeks, right? So it's like, it's dusty in here. 

Art: Mm-hmm. 

Austin: It's boarded up, you know?

Art: I bet you get real creepy cobwebs over here.

Austin: Yeah. Uh huh.

Janine: I think Es, in eyeball mode, like lays down on a couch. [Austin laughs sympathetically]

Art: I think Winded, Bleeding Duvall just sort of like rolls up in a corner, just like…

Austin: [sympathetic sigh] Alekest says: 

Austin (as Alekest): I'll get you both some water, and we'll have to figure out what we do next. 

Austin: Pickman, Marn, Bucho? Final shots of y'all?

Ali: Um, yeah.

Austin: Uh, I know what it is. I have a suggestion. I think, Marn, you're up on a pew or an altar or something. And Bucho is attending to you and is like hand on head to like check for fever and like checking to make sure your bones are set right and like, you know, doing the diagnostic. And we get Pickman coming in from out of the shadow, you know, lit by the candles in the room. And all of the candles in the room begin to melt down into the floor.
