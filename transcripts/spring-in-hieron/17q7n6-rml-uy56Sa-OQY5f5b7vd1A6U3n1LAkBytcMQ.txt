SPRING IN HIERON 26: AN ATTRACTIVE OFFER
Transcriber: Cole
(Recap)
Austin: It have been twelve hours since you first arrived at the gate outside of the peninsula of Alcyon. Bells ring to welcome the new day as the sun rises and they- they ring out a song. And somewhere in there, there are a set of three notes that you’ve never heard in person, as far as I know. But they are one of your weaknesses.
Dre: Um, there is a very loud banging noise, as Throndir’s grabbing two pots to put over his head to try and cover his ears and run away from the camp.

[Jack de Quidt’s “Something” begins playing in the background]
Austin: You step through this big grey gate and behind it, you finally can see the peninsula. And it is green and beautiful. And there are low hills, and I don’t know the last time you felt that things were at peace in this way. Like, once you pass through this gate, there is something idyllic here. And you take a nice boat journey along the coast, and it’s beautiful. I will say, Highwater gets a sniff of something and comes over to you, Ephrim, and says,
Austin (as Highwater): Lord. [whispering] I think those- I think those plants are poisonous. I can smell it.
---
Austin (as Tabard): I did not think I would see you again. Welcome to Alcyon.
Art (as Hadrian): [enthusiastically] Thank you.
---
Austin: Tabard nods and smiles and says,
Austin (as Tabard): Well, it’s funny because I was wondering. What is it you are here for because I- I cannot imagine a group of nine would travel so very far simply to remind us that the world outside our gates is not as peaceful as that inside.
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Samot mentioned there is a way to bolster our forces using… and apologies if this is uncouth, um because I know that this is not at all what you- your people here are, but pal- the pala-din of old almost [Austin/Tabard exhales briefly] to uh- Soldiers to help protect us and to hopefully stop what is going on with Ordenna.
Austin: There are some glances at the table. And Tabard says,
Austin (as Tabard): I think you misunderstand. We are the pala-din of old. You cannot put a being into a world like this and expect it to never develop a voice its own.
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Oh. Uh… That was not what I was implying at all.
[Music plays out to end]
---
Austin (as Tanyel): I do imagine a world where people like us are… everywhere. No longer kept to barracks. No longer always holding spears. I love to work the farm in the morning. I hope that on this journey we can aid each other, and perhaps [exhales] build a new idea of what beings like us are capable of.
Austin: I think and then Omera kind of butts in and says, looking out the window back towards the vineyards,
Austin (as Omera): If the world goes the way it is, those with bodies and hearts like ours, well, I suspect we will- we will find ourselves in positions we could never have dreamt when we were mere servants.
Austin: And there’s like, just the slightest tinge of pride in that. Not quite a threat, but like, ‘Hey, the new world might be built for us, not you.’ Um, and that’s a thing to consider. The like, post-dinner bell chimes. And Throndir, don’t worry, it does not chime for you. But it sounds like it might. I think we get two of the three notes.
Dre: Ahhh.
Austin: And then a third doesn’t come. And I actually think Kodiak goes like,
Austin (as Kodiak): Grrr.
Austin: Um, anything else at dinner here? Or do you want to wait until dinner breaks?
Dre: Well, I think when- Who was it that was talking about cooperation?
Austin: That was Tanyel- I mean everyone has-
[0:05:00]
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: -vaguely talked about it. But Tanyel, the anchor, was definitely-
Dre: Well, I think- like, when she says that, Kodiak kind of like, cocks his head and is like-
Austin: Hm. 
Dre (as Throndir): Um, I mean I’m just thinking out loud here, but you have an issue with space and have found a way to make use of these plants. We’re having problems with these plants and could use extra people-
Keith (as Fero): Don’t forget that we do have our own uh, refugee camp. 
Dre (as Throndir): I mean, yeah. 
Austin: Is that in character, Fero?
Keith: Um, yeah.
Austin: Ok. I think Tabard says, 
Austin (as Tabard): We’ve heard that the university has taken on a great many people. Are there problems with space for you, too?
Keith (as Fero): It’s not so much space as it happened so quickly.
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah. Well, and it- I think it would also be what- I mean I don’t want to also stick my foot in my mouth here, but I guess part of me is assuming that you know, pala-din doesn’t need the same living conditions as you know, someone that’s flesh and blood would. In terms of the type of shelter or- But I don’t know. 
Austin (as Tabard): I don’t know either. 
Austin: Says Tabard. 
Austin (as Tabard): I know that I spent my time in places built by humans and elves and wharvers. And I am accustomed to such spaces. Even in my military years I appreciated a room with a view.
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah. Fair enough. 
Keith (as Fero): Blue view?
Austin (as Tabard): Occasionally a blue view, Not as often as I would like. We certainly are not to put in closets or containers. And while we may not need to consume as much in the way of fuel or food, we have our needs. 
Austin: And like, I- I mean I think he’s pretty straight forward. He’s like, 
Austin (as Tabard): When you cut, your body heals itself. When you bleed, the blood clots. We have developed ways to repair ourselves. Special plasters. Special machines. 
Austin: And like, gestures with the prosthetic. 
Austin (as Tabard): But these require upkeep. These require talent, care, even in their use. It is not as simple as throwing us at a problem as a solution. But if you think of us in other ways, I would be happy to consider and bring up with committee the idea of opening an elective role to see if anyone would like to go visit the university and pitch in. Again, it would be elective. It is not my job to- 
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah. Of course. 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Of course. 
Austin (as Tabard): Ok. Just being clear. I’m a governor, not a king.
Sylvia (as Ephrim): [overlapped by Art] Um, all ask is- 
Art (as Hadrian): [quietly] A Lord Baron. 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Uh, [Keith laughs] all I ask is if you do that, let us know how we can prepare to make sure that your people are properly cared for when they are at the university. 
Austin: Um, [laughs lightly] Tanyel says, 
Austin (as Tanyel): Yes, of course. We will send- we will send along a manual. 
Austin: Um, and I don’t know that anchor can smile or grin, but there- She does like, a full body laugh. Like, and she makes laughing- mechanical laughing sound like, ‘Ha ha ha’. And her whole body shakes, and you can hear her metallic wings clink. Um, but- but- and Tabard says- Yeah.
Sylvia: Ephrim’s laughing along, but it’s like- [Austin laughs] ‘I’m embarrassed right now.’ Cause I said something bad. 
Austin: Uh huh. [Dre laughs] 
Art: Whereas I think Hadrian is like, all the way laughing hard. [Austin laughs hard] I think Hadrian like, thought that was really funny. 
Austin: Oh. Rosana like, raises her eyebrows briefly and puts a hand at Hadrian- [Keith laughs] the small of Hadrian’s back again like, ‘Uh huh, Honey. Yep.’ Um, god. Ben- and I think Benjamin says like, 
Austin (as Benjamin): Can I go study the- the-
Austin: I- Actually, I think what he says is like, 
Austin (as Benjamin): So, wait. You have like, schools and stuff here. Can I- Do you have books? Can I read? Is there stuff for me to read?
Keith: [joking as Benjamin] ‘Do you have homework?’
Austin: [jokingly as Benjamin] ‘Do you have homework for me to do? I haven’t done any homework this whole trip.’ [light laugh] ‘I did all the homework I brought twice.’
Dre: [jokingly as Benjamin] ‘The substitute teacher didn’t give us the homework we were supposed to do.’
Austin: ‘The ho-’
Dre: [jokingly as Benjamin] ‘The teacher said we were supposed to have homework.’
Austin: ‘The substitute teacher-’
Sylvia: He’s done three book reports on my fairytale book that I gave him. 
Austin: ‘I came in and the substitute teacher just put on ‘Romeo + Juliet’ three times all day.’ [Sylvia and Dre laugh] 
Sylvia: [laughing] Ugh.
Art: That’s good movie. [Dre laughs more]
Austin: [laughing] Yeah, it’s- [laughs more] 
[0:10:00]
Sylvia: One of Johnny Leguizamo’s best performances. 
Austin: Yeah, uh huh. It’s so good. Um, I think Tabard is like, 
Austin (as Tabard): Yes, of course. Of course. There’s a study in this building, and the conservatory to the north of course has its own libraries, but for now stay here if- if your parents-
Austin: And Rosana’s like, 
Austin (as Rosana): Yeah, you can go look at the library, honey. 
Austin: And Benjamin like, leaps off of this bench and sprints out the door, and Tabard is like, 
Austin (as Tabard): I didn’t- tell- Mm. It’s upstairs! It’s upstairs to the left! Alright. 
Art (as Hadrian): You don’t need to tell that kid how to find books. [Keith and Sylvia laugh]
Austin (as Tabard): He’s yours.
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah.
Austin (as Tabard): Your kid loves books.
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah, weird, right?
Austin (as Tabard): Weird. [Sylvia laughs again] 
Art (as Hadrian): I’ve read like, two books my whole life. 
Austin (as Tabard): Who wrote them?
Art (as Hadrian): Uh, Samothes. [Sylvia and Austin laugh] And um-
Austin: An evil priest. 
Art: [laughs] Yeah, and evil priest of some kind. 
Art (as Hadrian): An unnamed evil priest from the- the fourth century. 
Austin: God. [laughs] Very good. Um, yeah, so dinner breaks. Uh, does anyone else want to get- get to some shit tonight before- before like, the evening bell- or before the bedtime you know, happens? Before the bedtime happens. 
Dre: I gotta talk to Tabard about this-
Austin: Uh huh. 
Dre: -morning music stuff.
Austin: Uh hm. Um-
Sylvia: I have said enough words to these people. [light laugh]
Art: I’ll talk to Tabard in the morning. 
Austin: Ok. 
Keith: I’ve got- I have something for tonight, I think.
Austin: Ok. 
Keith: I want to- I want to do more investigating on the magic bit. Tomorrow’s my plant day. Today is my magic day. 
Austin: Nice. Nice. Nice. 
Art: Can’t skip plant day. 
Keith: No. 
Austin: Can never skip plant day. [light laugh] Um, what’s your deal tonight, Throndir? What are you- What’s- Where do you catch Tabard at?
Dre: Um, I don’t know. I guess after dinner. 
Austin: Yeah, I think he’s like- I think he’s smoking a hookah. 
Dre: Hell yeah. [laughs] 
Austin: There’s a hookah room here. Lots of cushions again. Um, and he is smoking his hookah. And he’s in- he is in like, silk, blue- I guess, no. Still this red and pink thing, pants and a robe. Uh, like a bathrobe or like a- like a- not as heavy as a smoking jacket even, you know? Um, and Tabard joins a long list of hot dudes on this show who don’t wear shirts at night. And is just hangin’. This is just his relax time.
Keith: A short list of hot dudes that are smoking hookah. 
Austin: That are- [laughs] The shortest list. [Dre laughs] And- and listen. Throndir-
Art: I think it’s just Tabard. 
Austin: It’s just Tabard right now, certainly. [laughs] Um, is this the first hookah we’ve had?
Dre: I think so.
Austin: Why do I imagine-
Keith: I feel- I feel like hookah’s come up before because I remember telling the story of uh- of trying to play D&D with my friends, and one of them brought a hookah, and it was a nightmare. 
Austin: [laughs] That’s extremely funny. 
Dre: I remember that story. 
Austin: That’s the worst game to be playing while a hookah-
Keith: I know. Like, it- it was- it was like the first campaign that he had played. And it was- it just turned into the like, set up a hookah thing where-
Austin: God. 
Keith: And it just like- I’m not paying attention to the game because I’m tr- fid- I’m fiddling with a hookah. 
Dre: And I got ashes all over my character sheet. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Keith: And like, pass- and like, passing the- I don’t know what it’s called. The like- the tube that you smoke out of. 
Austin: The hose. 
Keith: Yeah, the hose. 
Austin: Pass the hose. 
Keith: Passing the hose around. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: It’s gotta like, go over the table and not knock anything over, and I’m like tryin’- I’m trying to- I’m trying to GM, and it’s not going- It’s just like, ‘Ugh. This is not a good day.’
Austin: Oh, D- D&D You said DDR. Did I just hear DDR? [laughs] 
[crosstalking]
Keith: Did I say DDR? No, I- I didn’t- I think I said D&D.
Art: No, I I think you said D&D.
Keith: No, we were playing Dungeons and Dragons. 
Austin: Ok, I heard DDR. [laughs]
Keith: I was trying to GM a game of Dungeons and Dragons. [Sylvia laughs] 
Austin: [laughing] You need to understand. My image was- [Austin and Sylvia laugh hard] 
Keith: Yeah. 
Dre: No, that was my high school friends who smoked hookah and played DDR. 
Keith: This is-
Austin: -and played DDR. Ugh. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Keith: This is the same- this is the same guy that tried to fuckin’ kill a guard like, on- in the first session for no reason, and I got really mad. [laughs lightly]
Austin: That’s very funny. Uh, alright. So, where do you find-? So yeah, you find him in the hookah room. 
Dre: Uh hm. 
Austin: In the hookah lounge. You know, there’s probably some sort of low music playing from someone. [Dre laughs]  Or some- Yeah, I think there is like- there is probably a number of people here. It’s like, one of the rooms of the governor’s house to the southwest towards like, where there are more homes is just literally a hookah lounge. Has been converted into a hookah lounge. There is someone here playing music on a stringed instrument. 
And Tabard is you know, by himself in one corner. It’s kinda low lit by candles and stuff. And people are hanging out. Um, the pala-din are all about hookah because one, we’ve already talked about- they do flavor. They do lots of like, flavor chips and flavor things. But also, it’s about like- I think that there’s something about um, the way in which they can inhale the gas that just feels interesting to them. They are like, holding it in their- in their chest cavities in a weird way. 
[0:15:00]
It’s just like, a good, sensual like- you feel it in your body in a way that like, they don’t- they don’t eat food, you know? Um, Tabard, I believe, could eat food, but doesn’t need to. Based on the type of pala-din that- that he is. But he sees and waves at you. And like, says, 
Austin (as Tabard): Uh, Throndir! How are you doin’ tonight? I hope you’ve enjoyed the estate grounds.
Dre (as Throndir): No, I mean it’s- it’s great here. 
Austin (as Tabard): So, you’ve traded in the bow, huh? You a- 
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah. 
Austin (as Tabard): Is that a- Did-
Dre (as Throndir): A lot has happened.
Austin (as Tabard): You’re a goddamn cop. [Keith and Sylvia laugh hard] 
Dre (as Throndir): That’s harsh. 
Keith: Fuckin’ harsh words from a governor. Geez. [Austin and Keith laugh] 
Austin (as Tabard): The Golden Lance. The snow elf is-
Dre (as Throndir): I feel like last time we met, you were like the most cop person I’d ever met. And now you’re calling me a cop.
Austin (as Tabard): I- I’m just saying things change. [light laugh] 
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah, no. Fair. 
Austin (as Tabard): Uh, take a seat. How can I help you?
Dre (as Throndir): Uh, so… this morning and throughout the day, you all play music. 
Austin (as Tabard): Yes? 
Dre (as Throndir): Is it the same- is it the same songs everyday at the same times? 
Austin (as Tabard): Uh, yeah. Yes. Of course. We mark the day in a way that those people of Alcyon did years ago.
Dre (as Throndir): Hm. 
Austin (as Tabard): Important meals. The boats going out to sea. Any special holidays. Etcetera. 
Dre (as Throndir): Huh, ok. Something happened this morning to me. Um, how much do you know about the Golden Lance?
Austin: How much does he know about the Golden Lan- Uh, you know. Hm. [louder] Hm. 
Keith: I’m sorry. Quick interruption. Do I know that Throndir’s a vampire? Do we all know?
Dre: I... think so.
Austin: I don’t know.
Keith: I don’t think I know. I don’t think that Fero knows. 
Dre: I don’t think we’ve ever had-
Austin: Who is-? Oh. Oh. Mm. Yeah, yeah. No, no, I have such clear memories of Throndir saying to Fero that Arrell killed him.
Dre: Oh, yes. Yeah, uh huh. 
Keith: Yeah, you’re right. 
Austin: But I don’t know that you were ever very explicit as to like, what the deal was you made. I-
Sylvia: I’m just gonna-
Austin: You know what I- Here’s- here’s the real answer. The real answer is it hasn’t come up. So, if someone- if you once told someone, ‘listen I made a deal with the Golden Lance which makes me a little different than other people,’ it hasn’t impacted daily life that often. So, I imagine it would’ve slipped.
Sylvia: We’ve been working together for a decade, I hope I know.
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: I hope you know, too. You- Y’all can decide. Y’all have control of this. 
Keith: Who knew- who knew how bad your hand was?
Dre: I- I think at that point-
Austin: Right. Good question. 
Dre: What’d you say, Keith? I’m sorry. 
Keith: Oh, Sylvia said that uh, that because Ephrim and Throndir have been working together for a decade that um, that Ephrim should know, but then I said, ‘Who knew about how bad your hand was?’
Sylvia: Throndir did. He was there when that happened.
Dre: True. 
Keith: Yeah, but didn’t it get worse and you weren’t really telling people. 
Sylvia: Ok. That’s fair. Yeah. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Sylvia: Ok, nevermind. 
Dre: So, I think it’s probably something similar to that. Whereas people know to varying degrees, but I think it’s even like, the stuff that happened this morning and as far as like, this new level of hunger-er- hung-eer? 
Austin: Uh hm. [light laugh]
Keith: It’s a different kind of hunger is pronounced ‘hungeer.’
Dre: Yeah. Yeah, thank you. Umlauts over that ‘e’ for vampire hunger. Um, Throndir didn’t know about those. So, I don’t think anybody knows about that stuff.
Austin: Mm. Ok. 
Dre: But I think it’s probably come up. Like, you know there’s been meals where like, Throndir just hasn’t eaten.
Austin: Uh hm. 
Dre: And people have been like, ‘What’s up?’ And as far as it’s-
Austin: And he’s like, ‘uh…’
Keith: Not fresh enough.
Dre: [laughing] Yeah. [Keith laughs]
Sylvia: [quietly] Oh my god.
Dre: I’m a real picky eater.
Austin: Right. 
Dre: We ran out of ketchup, and I just gotta- I gotta cover it in ketchup [Austin laughs] so I can eat it. 
Austin: Um, so yeah. I think- I would suspect that given his rela- Ok. One, I think it’s complicated because I don’t know that we’ve talked about what the situation with the Golden Lance is inside of the City of First Light. 
Dre: Mm. That’s fair. 
Austin: Because it diverges, right? Like, we know that right after the winter holiday game, the flashback about um, the market that uh, the Golden Lance members- God, I forget what one of their- Um, one of them is Claret Holiday. But who’s the other one that left?
Dre: Well, yeah. What if we just make this instead of it being Throndir asking what Tabard knows about the whole Golden Lance-
Austin: Right. 
Dre: -it’s ‘what do you know about, you know-’
Austin: The outside.
Dre: ‘-Gloria Lake and uh, Victoria Solomon?.’
Austin: [simultaneously] Right and Victoria Solomon. And I suspect just like, I think that he’s like, 
[0:20:00]
Austin (as Tabard): Well, um, they are a- what’s the- They are zealous believers of justice. They wield weapons of great power, which I see you have one of slung across your back. And they- let’s say there are some unexplainable things about them. 
Dre (as Throndir): Ok, you’re- Ok. So, like, we can- we can just say vampires.
Austin: His eyes go super wide. 
Austin (as Tabard): Uh, vampires?
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah. 
Austin (as Tabard): Do they- [whispers] do they suck people’s blood?
Dre (as Throndir): No. 
Austin (as Tabard): I knew that it was hard to kill them, and I knew that they had some magical- They’re vampi- Are you a vampire?
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah. It was a- it was a whole thing. 
Austin (as Tabard): Well, I hate to be the bearer of bad news… [foley of smoking]
Austin: And he takes a puff.
Austin (as Tabard): No one here has any blood for you.
Dre (as Throndir): Well, I know. And it doesn’t even work that way. Um…
Austin (as Tabard): You’re serious. 
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah. 
Keith: Now who’s putting their foot in their mouth? [Dre laughs] 
Austin: [light laugh] Yeah. 
Dre (as Throndir): Here’s the thing. It hasn’t really meant that much to me while I was at the university. I don’t know if it’s been a time thing. If it’s me being outside of the university for the first time in a very long time. Um, this morning when the bells played, it was… awful. I don’t even know how to describe it. It was awful. 
Austin (as Tabard): And you think this has- [light laugh] I suspect you’re not just saying the playing was poor. 
Dre (as Throndir): No. No, I-
Austin (as Tabard): Vampires have weaknesses, I understand. Is yours music? That seems unlikely.
Dre (as Throndir): Well, it was only a specific part of the song. And there’s been parts of the day where it is seemingly about to play, but it- you know, it’s- it’s- I don’t know how many notes or if it’s like a measure or-
Austin (as Tabard): This seems difficult. 
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah. 
Austin (as Tabard): Um, are you-? You’re asking me if-
Dre (as Throndir): No. I can’t ask you to not- I’m not gonna ask you to change an entire cultural institution of your city. 
Austin (as Tabard): Well, that’s good because again [Dre laughs] even if I agreed, actually getting that done would take-
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah. 
Austin (as Tabard): -seven months.
Dre (as Throndir): Is there- is there somewhere I could go? [Austin/Tabard exhales] Where I wouldn’t be able to hear it?
Austin (as Tabard): You could wake up early and take a boat out-
Dre (as Throndir): I don’t sleep, so- 
Austin (as Tabard): You don’t sleep. 
Dre (as Throndir): No, I don’t need to. 
Austin (as Tabard): I see. N- I actually- Now that I think about it, neither do I. 
Austin: [still in Tabard’s voice, Dre laughs] Do I sleep? I guess I don’t need to sleep. Do any of us need to sleep?
Keith: You sleep socially. 
Austin: I do a social sleep situation. 
Dre: Mm. 
Austin: Um- [laughs] Uh, I think-
Dre: It gets weird cause then you like, close your eyes and you’re trying to like, fake it so that other people don't feel weird. 
Austin: I think he says like, um, 
Austin (as Tabard): Before the sun rises, you could take a small boat out. Though I suspect on a clear day, the sound would echo. Um, have you tried covering your ears?
Dre (as Throndir): Uh, I did this morning. Um, granted it was with um, our very nice egg pan and our sauce pot. That didn’t work great. 
Austin (as Tabard): I see. Just whatever you had at hand. And that was not a- I’m guessing a conscious strategy, 
Dre (as Throndir): No. Uh un. [Art laughs once] 
Austin: Would they just have some sort of like, quiet room or a sensory deprivation room- ?
Dre: Or like, ear-
Austin: Or like a- ear plugs? 
Dre: Do they have AirPods?
Austin: They don’t have AirPods. [Sylvia laughs] No. 
Dre: Oh god. Throndir’s got AirPods in.
Austin: [laughing] Throndir wearing AirPods! [Dre and Austin laugh throughout] With a big dog! And- and the Drake coat on. Fuck it. God. Done. 
Dre: Who do I got to commission?
Austin: [laughing] Yeah. [Sylvia laughs] So funny. Ugh. Um, it’s so funny. Blue views from the Six. 
Sylvia: [laughs] Oh god. 
Austin: I think maybe he says, [light laugh] Um, I’m tryin’ to- tryin’ to get him to a place where it’s like- I think maybe he just- He can make this guess.
Austin (as Tabard): If you somehow distorted the sound or covered it with other sound so that you wouldn’t hear it?
Dre (as Throndir): Hm, maybe. 
[0:25:00]
Austin (as Tabard): If- That early, there isn’t much in the way of-
Austin: Actually, yeah. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea that this is just a culture that does not adhere to like, a twenty-four hour like- or like, a traditional sixteen, seventeen, eighteen hour day. Ya know?
Dre: Right. 
Keith: I feel that. 
Austin: Uh, I kind of like the idea of just like, ‘yeah, there are people outside with suspicious torches in the middle of the night debating logic and you know, ethics and painting.’ You know?
Dre: This torch is not suspicious. Change my mind. [Austin laughs] 
Keith: Give me a- give me- Honestly, give me a twenty-eight hour cycle. I’m- I’m into it. 
Austin: You’re here for it. Yeah. 
Keith: I’m here for it. 
Austin: Um, but so yeah. So, maybe- maybe he’s like, 
Austin (as Tabard): There’s a place that you can go in- in Coraline to the southwest. It’d be a couple of an hour walk in the middle of the day- er the middle of the night, but uh, loud music, good entertainment, and I suspect you wouldn’t be able to hear the bells over that. 
Dre (as Throndir): Ok. 
Austin (as Tabard): Though also you could stay here. You could submerge your entire head in water and hope that that-
Dre (as Throndir): I did that. 
Austin (as Tabard): No- no luck?
Dre (as Throndir): No. 
Austin (as Tabard):  Hm. Well, it was a thought.
Dre (as Throndir): The river’s great for swimming though, if the- if the urge ever strikes you. 
Austin (as Tabard): Not much of a swimmer. Little heavy for it. But good luck. And please be careful with our people.
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah. Hey, wait. No, hold on. 
Austin (as Tabard): I- 
Austin: He’s like, 
Austin (as Tabard): I understand that you have your needs, but I will not have anyone hurt under my watch. 
Dre (as Throndir): Listen, if I hurt someone, I would want you to-
Keith: Punish you? 
Dre: I think it’s actually better if Throndir just kind of leaves that in the air. 
Austin: Uh huh. Uh huh. 
Dre: Cause I think it’s- he realized what he was saying. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Dre: And he still means it, but it’s-
Austin: But. Uh hm. 
Dre: -hard to say. 
Austin: Alright. Fero. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: What’s the thing you wanted to do tonight?
Keith: Um, so I want to try something first. I- I feel like this is the place that does have some like, a lot of resources and people that- that do know things. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Keith: But I think Fero’s first instinct is to um- is to try to- Shit, what’s the name of the move? Let me get in here. Uh, try to look for guidance. 
Austin: Ok. Yeah, what’s that move?
Keith: Cause-
Austin: How’s that move do- What’s the move? Uh, can you read it to me?
Keith: Yeah, so. It is a- Is it a level one spell or is it a- like, a cantrip or something? I don’t- It doesn’t- I don’t have it listed here, but I have to use Commune to use spells, I think? I’ve- I’ve only done- I’ve only used a spell I think one other time. 
Austin: Ok. 
Keith: But it says, ‘the symbol of your deity appears before you-’
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: ‘-and gestures towards direction or course of action.’ Uh, and so the thing was that- So, I- I’ve actually used this twice before. Once to ask directly for help from Samol. 
Austin: Yes. Yeah. 
Keith: And then once again after Samol died, kind of to see what would happen. 
Austin: Yes. 
Keith: And I don’t know if you remember what you described to me. 
Austin: I do. I do. I mean this is part of how you found out about Alcyon, right?
Keith: Yes. 
Austin: Was like the land itself kind of spoke to you. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah. Uh, so you’re gonna cast the spell again.
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Right? Ok, yeah. So, this is Cast a Spell is the name of the move which should be on your main sheet. Yeah, it is. Just click that. 
Keith: Ok. Cast a Spell. Here is it. Eleven.
Austin: [simultaneously] Eleven! Awesome. So, again Guidance says, ‘A symbol of your deity appears before you and gestures towards direction or course of action your deity would have you take and then disappears. The message is through gesture only. Your communication through the spell is severely limited.’ So, where are you when you cast the spell?
Keith: Um, I think- Yeah, so I’ve- I’ve gone- Hm. Maybe I- maybe I went near the uh, Galenica statue.
Austin: Yeah, I kind of had the similar- a similar vibe there, for sure. Um, so I think the first thing is that their- their eyes- the statue’s eyes, the kind of orange opaline eyes- light up and like, cast you in light. There’s like a spotlight effect here. Um, and I think- [exhales] So, there’s- One of the eyes lights you up, and the other points back at the governor’s house. Um, and also, while you’re here, you can- One thing that you’ll note is like, when you’re near the statue, there’s a lot of weird dust in the air here, which your mask is-
Keith: Hm. 
Austin: If you- if you’re wearing a mask, a mask protecting from it. But there is definitely some weird fuckin’ dust here from- 
[0:30:00]
There’s like, stoneworks and forgeworks and like, blacksmith shops and- or like, blacksmith tables and you know, anvils and all sorts of chisels. And this is where they make stuff, is under Galenica’s shield basically. Like, in- below the tower that is Galenica’s body, or the statue of Galenica, at least. And so, one of the- one of the eyes lights you up. And the other points a beam at the governor’s house. Back at the governor’s house, at a room on the second floor. Um, very simple. But that is- that is what you see. 
Keith: Ok. And- and this- this statue tower thing-
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: Do- Do I hear- If I- Can I- If- Do I- It has- it has powers.
Austin: Uh, yeah. 
Keith: It’s- it has some sort of magic. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: Can I talk to it?
Austin: What’s the-
Keith: I can talk to rock. 
Austin: You can talk to rock, yeah. 
Keith: And I can talk to you know, gods and-
Austin: Yeah. Totally.
Keith: -people and other sorts of things. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Keith: Um, and there’s no really- real restrictions on Thing Talker at all. 
Austin: Yeah, it’s just- Um, what’s it say? Uh, yeah. Study- You can use Spirit Tongue, Shapeshifting, and Studied Essence to creatures and anim- or to plants and rocks as well as- as well as animals, right? Um-
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: It- Thing Talker- or Spirit Tongue does say ‘things you’ve studied or akin to essences you’ve studied or- or things from your native land,’ but Galenica is your native land in a real way. 
Keith: Yeah. I mean I have-
Austin: You are a druid of- Yes.
Keith: -part of my body’s literally made of granite.
Austin: Yes. Of- Right, I think part of that granite is in this statue. Like, when you look at the leg of Galenica, that statue, that rock is that same rock. 
Keith: Uh hm. 
Austin: So, yeah. So, you can- you can talk to the statue. What do you say?
Keith: Um, 
Keith (as Fero): Excuse me?
Austin: Um, [exhales] And you can hear the sound of it turning like a body- like a body of rock to face you. But it stays still. But like, you can feel that the body inside the- of the statue- or the soul inside of the statue is creaking and turning and crumbling-
Keith: Hm. 
Austin: and it faces you. Um, and they say, 
Austin (as Galenica statue): Our Fero. Hello. You’ve traveled far to see me.
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. I’m surprised- I have a question. 
Austin (as Galenica statue ): Of course. 
Keith (as Fero): Have we met? [Sylvia laughs] 
Austin (as Galenica statue): Of course. 
Keith (as Fero): Ok. Well, I wasn’t sure if this was the same Galenica. I wasn’t sure if-
Austin (as Galenica statue): We are the same in many ways.
Keith (as Fero): Ok. Um, so yeah. So, how’s it goin’?
Austin (as Galenica statue): My shield stands.
Austin: I should describe like- This is a statue of Galenica who is this rock person we’ve described as having like, features like bath salts, rocks- this kind of like, again, bright orange opal eyes and in this case, they are wearing armor, and they have a giant shield. Like a tower shield. Not squared off like that. I think it’s kind of um, like a flat line at the top, and then it kind of dips down a little bit, and then like, curves up so there’s like a- almost like a spear shape shield. Do you know what I’m talking about? Like, if you took a spearhead or an arrowhead and then lengthened it out so it was like a- a shield that would reach from the ground up to someone’s torso. Their body is holding that like, plant- implanted into the ground, facing out to the ocean. And so yeah, they say, 
Austin (as Galenica statue): My shield still stands.
Austin: Which is to say ‘it’s well. Things are- things are good.’
Keith: Ok. 
Austin: ‘-here.’ Uh, I think that’s what they say-
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: They say, 
Austin (as Galenica statue): Here my shield still stands. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, I guess that’s kind of what I- I’m hoping to talk about. Um, do you know how bad everything is?
Austin (as Galenica statue): Yes, and that is why I left.
Keith (as Fero): Um, do you know about- did you hear about Samol?
Austin (as Galenica statue): I felt it. I am not as close kin as the others, but he will be lost- er he will be missed.
Keith (as Fero): And did you feel magic receding from the continent?
Austin (as Galenica): I have felt what much of the continent already knew. That time is fleeting. In the east, Severea and I stitched closed wounds for eons. Now the rest of the world knows what those wounds bring. 
[0:35:00]
Austin (as Galenica, cont.): The death of magic itself. And we have run the last of the Grand Tour’s route, I suspect. Severea is now bringing some north to the new land where Del fell into the- into the ocean hoping to create a new home. And I wander the continent wondering where I should plant my shield.
Keith (as Fero): Oh, I guess that’s- Um, can you have two shield- Can- Does planting your shield somewhere else mean there’s no shield here?
Austin (as Galenica): Fero, the humans who once called this peninsula home, upon seeing the Heat and the Dark for the first time, were filled with such terror and awe that they brought me into being hoping that I would protect them. But in time, as Samol grew older, as his sons went to war over what should be done, I was convinced by Severea’s argument that Alcyon was no more important than the rest of the world. And so, I left this place to join the Grand Tour and keep as many safe as possible. I abdicated my responsibility to this place, but those who stayed insisted that I was theirs. 
Austin (as Galenica, cont.): And so they rebuilt me here. I had left them a small part of myself, but they demanded all of me. And so they built a replica, divine in its shape. And so now, I stand and yet wander, protecting this shore yet exploring the forest at the same time. What they failed to understand is, in rebuilding me, in holding me here in service, they only assured that I would protect this land and not them. I will say these pala-din who have taken it, they seem a right sort. Certainly less demanding than the humans who once called this place home. There are two shields. 
Keith (as Fero): Great. 
Austin (as Galenica): If that answers your question.
Keith (as Fero): Yep. Thank you. Yep. Um, but the rest of that was- Yeah. I like that. Uh, you know. [Austin and Sylvia laugh] Good speech. Um, I guess that answers everything. You find a good- you find a good spot for your shield? The center, right? That’s a good spot. Like, the middle.
Austin (as Galenica): Perhaps. You are there, yes? Your people.
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, close-ish.
Austin (as Galenica): We will see where I land. 
Keith (as Fero): Ok. 
Austin (as Galenica): I will decide. But perhaps I will find reason to visit. I am glad you are well, Fero. 
Keith (as Fero): Thanks.
Austin (as Galenica): The last we spoke was… There was more passion than I tend to bring to such encounters. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, me too. But I start high anyway. [Austin laughs lightly] 
Austin: Ha ha ha. [Keith laughs]
Keith: [half in character] You laugh like a horse I know. [Austin, Keith, and Dre laugh hard]
Austin: [laughing] You laugh like a horse I am sometimes. [Keith and Sylvia laugh] Um-
Austin (as Galenica): Did you not need my guidance still?
Austin: And the light on the governor’s house beams brighter.
Keith (as Fero): Oh yeah. No, that’s- What’s up there?
Austin (as Galenica): The boy, Benjamin and a guest.
Keith (as Fero): Who’s the guest?
Austin: Hadrian. 
Keith: Wait. 
Austin: Where are you?
Keith: Oh, ok. [laughs lightly] 
Art: Um-
Austin: Dinner’s over. You know, it’s-
Art: What time is it?
Austin: It’s like post-dinner. It’s hoo- it’s the hookah hour.
Art: Ah, the hookah hour. 
Austin:  Uh, Benjamin’s still in the library. And you know, no one’s made their trip back to the other villa yet, but I think it’s probably like, getting time to go. 
Art: Um, perhaps Rosana and I found like, a balcony to-
Austin: Yeah. Yeah, exactly. 
Art: -look out of. 
Austin: It’s beautiful. You know?
Art: I bet. Did you even- You’ve never asked me where I was because something good was about to happen?
[0:40:00]
Austin: Never. I don’t think I’ve ever done that, have I?
Art: Probably right now though. 
Austin: Oh yeah. 
Keith: Benjamin has a strange visitor. Anyway, Hadrian-
Austin: Uh hm. I think, yeah, Rosana is probably like,
Austin (as Rosana): We should be getting back. Can you go get Benjamin? I’ll get our things and meet you downstairs and find Omera and Tanyel and whoever else is staying with us. Uh, Throndir. 
Keith: Um, is uh-
Art (as Hadrian): Yes, we all- we all forget Throndir sometimes.
Art: Um, yeah, so um, I guess Hadrian- Did we- It’s upstairs. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: Tabard said it was upstairs.
Austin: It’s upstairs to the left. 
Keith: [simultaneously] To the left.
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: To the left. Ok, yeah. So, uh-
Austin: Yes. 
Art: -Hadrian goes upstairs and to the left, and I hope there’s only one door. I just go to-
Austin: There’s only- Well, you- I think you probably peek through a few doors, and you know, there’s like a door with someone’s doing some like, painting inside. There’s like a painting class. There’s another door, and you peek-
Keith: Yeah, roll to get the right door. 
Austin: Yeah, uh huh. I’m not gonna make you roll to it, but you know, you definitely have to peek into a few doors. There’s a- there’s a third story bath which is too high for a bath honestly. And then there is- there is the library. 
Keith: Like a public bath?
Austin: LIke a, yeah. Like a public bath. Uh hm. And then there is the library. And it’s big. It’s like, fairly big, and you can hear like, people talking inside. Um, and I mean, you know where this is, right? You know what this is. Like-
Art: I need you to say it. 
Austin: [sighs] Benjamin and Arrell are talking about a book they found. 
Art: Mm.
Austin: And it’s not even anything that interesting or powerful. It’s- it’s literally a version of the- I think it’s- it’s probably literally the book that Devar and the rest of that crew walked into. And it’s Arrell being like, ‘Of course, this is nonsense. What really happened-’ and is giving a version of the story that Fero just learned about Galenica. And- and I- You see him from the back with like, his hair which was- it was last time you saw Arrell that kind of dark brown, but now it’s greying and in fact, there’s bald spots where it’s not growing anymore at all. There’s a least one spot where you think you can see skull. 
Keith: Even a lich can’t stop-
Austin: Yeah. [light laugh] Uh huh.
Keith: -baldness.
Austin: Nope. [laughs]
Art: I think liches worse than most. 
Austin: Probably. Probably. Um, and Benjamin is- [exhales] looks up at you. Like, I think is sitting at a table, and Arrell is there also, is like leaning, not over Benjamin, but like, to the side. And Benjamin just- er Arrell just turns his head to look at you. And says,
Austin (as Arrell): Ah, Hadrian. Finally. 
Austin: And stands up and like, 
Austin (as Arrell): Keep reading.
Austin: And walks over to you. 
Art (as Hadrian): [calmly] What are you doing here?
Austin (as Arrell): This is a beautiful place. 
Art (as Hadrian): Uh hm. 
Austin (as Arrell): Safe. And… filled with incredible power. 
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah. What are you doin’ here?
Austin (as Arrell): I’ve come to make an offer, Hadrian. 
Art (as Hadrian): Ok. 
Austin (as Arrell): And I come out of good will. 
Austin: And he has his staff, and he’s like, walking with it. Um, long, black and silver thing. There’s like a black core with a line of silver that wraps around it. And at the very top is something that- It- it almost looks like a- [exhales] It’s basically a lion’s paw, like a dandelion. Like a white dandelion. But the- all the little white bits are like, hovering in place magically. They’re not connected to the- to the core. And he says, 
Austin (as Arrell): The people here will survive whatever comes next. Whether protected by Galenica or by their nature. It is not my primary plan, but if I knew how to build pala-din, I could begin to build us all new bodies. Things that would survive the Spring. 
Art (as Hadrian): You know who’d love to hear about this is Tabard, the governor of this settlement? Uh, he’s right downstairs, I think in the hookah lounge. We could go right now. 
Austin (as Arrell): Sure, you would bring him to me?
Art (as Hadrian): I would bring you to him. 
Austin (as Arrell): Fair. I would love an introduction. 
Art (as Hadrian): Great. 
Austin (as Arrell): We could also do this privately though. 
Art (as Hadrian): I don’t know that we can. 
[0:45:00]
Austin (as Arrell): Hm. I see. Will you not let me make the offer? I will rescind Benjamin’s status as conduit if you can guarantee me those plans. And the pla-
Art (as Hadrian): I can’t.
Austin (as Arrell): Huh. I see. 
Art (as Hadrian): And not from lack of finding that to be an attractive offer. But it’s a guarantee I can’t make. 
Austin (as Arrell): What is in your way?
Art (as Hadrian): I’m- [exhales and pauses] To- In short? Decorum. 
Austin (as Arrell): Decorum?!
Art (as Hadrian): The plans are not being given to me. I would need to-
Austin (as Arrell): Take them. This is-
Art (as Hadrian): I am- they’re going to be in the custody of my- of my friend, Lord Ephrim. And I do not steal from my friends.
Austin (as Arrell): [laughs] Oh. Lord Ephrim. Hadrian, men like Ephrim will not see us through tomorrow. Decorum. 
Art (as Hadrian): Ephrim is brave and capable. 
Austin (as Arrell): How many starve? How many pile around your university?
Art (as Hadrian): I am not really in charge of keeping track of either of those things. 
Austin (as Arrell): I know. I know. I know. I know. Ephrim is. And the- the unstill, Corsica. [light laugh] And neither of them have- Bravery yes. I will give you bravery. And they have capabilities. Corsica is a fantastic military commander, certainly. And Ephrim… devout in his way. But leaders? [pause] Neither sees the big picture. Neither devotes themselves. And I know you understand devotion. The cost of it. 
Art (as Hadrian): I do. I can’t do this thing for you. You should- you should really consider talking to Tabard like a reasonable person. 
Austin (as Arrell): Do you believe I haven’t already?
Art (as Hadrian): I do believe that. 
Austin (as Arrell): I’m disappointed, but I suppose not surprised. Do you know Tabard didn’t even remember me?
Art (as Hadrian): You didn’t really meet. 
Austin (as Arrell): Of course we met. All that time I spent in his master’s home. Ugh. 
Austin: Shakes his head. 
Art (as Hadrian): No, you didn’t. But- but you didn’t. You know?
Austin (as Arrell): Hadrian, you are a strong man, but a very confused one. You have raised a wonderful child. Very smart. 
Art (as Hadrian): Uh huh. 
Austin (as Arrell): He does you justice. 
Art (as Hadrian): I wholeheartedly agree. 
Austin (as Arrell): Sleep on the offer. I do not know if the peace our settlements have will last now that the Ordennans move the way they do. I-
Art (as Hadrian): You know what would be a great thing for you to do is deal with this Ordennan problem.
Austin (as Arrell): Do you-
Art (as Hadrian): That would really, I think, endear you to the people in the university. 
Austin (as Arrell): What is it you suspect I could do with an army? Other than destroy the Ordennans forever. 
Art (as Hadrian): I don’t know. I- I sort of thought that you might be in position to do that already. Anyway, you should get out of here. I’ll go talk to some people, and uh, let’s meet back here tomorrow. 
Austin (as Arrell): Tomorrow? Make this a regular thing. I’d show up with a cup of tea. And you would be here with Throndir, presumably. I know how your mind works. 
Art (as Hadrian): Throndir’s gonna be mad about this. 
Austin (as Arrell): Throndir has gotten in my way too many times. 
Art (as Hadrian): But yeah, you’re right. I’m gonna tell everyone. 
Austin (as Arrell): Feel free. 
Art (as Hadrian): Literally, everyone I see I’m gonna tell. Some of them aren’t gonna make any sense of it. I’ll be like, [Keith and Austin laugh] ‘Yo, the wizard Arrell was here last night.’ And they’ll be like, ‘I don’t know who that is.’ And I’ll be like, ‘Well, you know, just be careful.’
Austin (as Arrell): Please. I’m no mere wizard.
Art (as Hadrian): I’m- Do you- do you have a concise title?
Austin (as Arrell): I’m earning one. [overlapped] Be well. 
Art (as Hadrian): If you don’t have a replacement for me to say, I can’t- I’l- I’ll call you whatever you want to be called. [Austin/Arrell sighs] But you have to tell me. I can’t- I can’t guess.
[0:50:00]
Austin: [car horn blasts in background] God, does he- phew.
Keith: Someone’s angry. 
Austin: This is- yeah, that’s him outside. I gotta look at some spells really quick. Um-
Art: Oh, I just want to just- just to clarify on a mechanical basis-
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: That I believe that this constitutes a threat to my loved ones. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: And I am currently burning with righteous anger.
Austin: Fair. Uh-
Art: Holding three payback. 
Austin: Uh huh. Um-
Art: Which gives me the ability to act suddenly with conviction, catching my foe off guard. 
Austin: That’s good. 
Keith: Yeah, because Austin’s looking at spells. 
Austin: I am looking at spells. 
Art: Yeah. I just want- I just want to- to have my- a payback chance. 
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: Definitely. 
Keith: Fero presumably knows Arrell is up here by now, right?
Austin: Oh ye- Uh, well, you know that there’s a problem, certainly, right?
Keith: Yeah. I mean the last thing I did was ask Galenica, 
Keith (as Fero): Who’s up there? Who- who’s up there with Benjamin?
Austin: Right. Right. Yes. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Art: If Galenica tells you the proper title, you should tell Hadrian, so- cause Hadrian needs to tell some people about this.
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: Galenica tells you, 
Austin (as Galenica): The Great Lich, Arrell.
Keith (as Fero):  Oh ok, well then-
Austin: Or, 
Austin (as Galenica): The Grand Lich, Arrell. 
Art: Ooo, you know what I bet Hadrian didn’t bring to dinner?
Austin: A sword. Um-
Art: Or armor. 
Austin: No. He touches your shoulder. He’s like, 
Austin (as Arrell): Tomorrow then. 
Austin: If you want to spend that hold, you should do it now. 
Art: Yeah, I’m gonna just- I’m gonna push him. 
Austin: Uh, is that like, an attack? Like, what is that?
Art: That’s- I’m just breaking contact.
Austin: But- Ok, well then I’m still gonna need you to make a wisdom Defy Dex- er Defy Danger. Unless you’re pushing him away before he can touch you, which I guess is what you could do. 
Art: Yeah, I’m- I’m trying to- 
Austin: Ok. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Art: I don’t want him to- I’m using a payback, and I’m-
Austin: So, then-
Art: I’m giving him a shove. 
Austin: Ok. What’s- How does payback work? What’s the thing it says?
Art: I spend one payback-
Austin: Uh hm. 
Art: -to act suddenly and with conviction catching your foe off guard. 
Austin: Alright, give- That- I think that’s fine. I don’t need to make you roll for that then. He’s like- and he like, raises his other hand, as if to say like, ‘well played. Well played. You’re protected here. You didn’t let me cast Dominate on you’ which would have been very bad. 
Art: Ooo, I bet. 
Austin: And he says-
Art: Ooo, I can also use payback to throw off the effects of being stunned, confused, or enchanted, so-
Austin: Look at that. Damn, you- you built yourself into an anti-wizard machine. [Keith laughs] Very good. And he says- nods at you and says, 
Austin (as Arrell): Perhaps I underestimated you. 
Art (as Hadrian): Perhaps. 
Austin: Fero, if you want to be here now, you can be here now. 
Keith: Um-
Austin: If you don’t want to be here, you don’t need to be, but up to you. 
Keith: Yeah, ok. I- Here’s- I mean, here’s what I’m s- Here’s what I’m assuming. I think I like, run to the- to the second floor, into the library, and I- just as I see like- just as I see Hadrian push Arrell, and I’m like, ‘oh no, it’s a fight.’ And I like, turn into a bear. [light laugh] 
Austin: Um, at that, I think Benjamin like, leaps up and um, reaches for a uh- I guess like, just lifts his- his hands in the air to begin to try to like, cast a spell. And is like- and Arrell is like, 
Austin (as Arrell): I believe it’s time for me to go. I value you all too much to stay. 
Art (as Hadrian): Great. 
Austin: Does anyone do anything before he teleports away?
Art: No, I think we’re-
Keith: Yeah, I’ll try to attack him. 
Art: -wildly unmatched. 
Austin: Alright. 
Art: Ok. 
Austin: Give me a Hack and Slash. 
Keith: Well, first I’ve got- I have to do my animal roll. I have to do my-
Austin: Oh my god. 
Keith: Um, uh, alright. So, Shapeshifter. 
Austin: Eleven. Hold three.
Keith: That’s an eleven, so I have three hold. 
Austin: And you’re a bear. [light laugh] 
Keith: I’m a bear which- so, dangerous attack. Oh no, that’s the wrong thing. 
Austin: That’s the- 
Keith: That’s just-
Austin: You rolled 1d8, that’s not it. 
Keith: That’s Hack and Slash is what I meant. Ten. 
Austin: Ten, alright. So, when you do ten you can- you can either deal your damage safely, or you can deal your damage plus 1d6 damage.
Keith: I’m gonna do that. I’m gonna do plus- I’m gonna do plus 1d6.
Austin: Ok. Go ahead and-
Keith: So, I- So, I can roll a dangerous attack and then a regular attack, I believe is what I can do. 
Austin: What’s that from?
Keith: Uh, that’s- regular- So, that’s just-
Austin: What’s-
Keith: I have quick things here that let me do uh- I have like, a hotkey that just rolls another die is what I mean.
Austin: That is that 1d6. I got you. Yeah.
Keith: Yeah, yeah. 
Austin: That’s fine then. 
Keith: Alright. Well, great. So, one, three.
Austin: Three. 
Keith: Oh my god. 
Austin: Uh, you know, there is a magical- As you’re- you’re claws like, pierce where his flesh should be and in fact, there is nothing there. Like, you tear- you tear the cloth of his robe, and it instantly repairs itself, right?
Keith: Uh hm. 
[0:55:00]
Austin: But as you do, he simply like, slips the- the staff he’s carrying just like, a little bit forward, as if he was like trying to trip someone. Like, you know what I mean? Like, the kind of like, very light tap. 
Keith: Yeah, very subtle. Yeah. 
Austin: And all of those uh, the dandelion spores- or what are those called? You know what I’m talkin’ about?
Keith: Yeah, yeah. The-
Art: They’re like seeds, aren’t they?
Austin: Seeds. 
Keith: -they’re seeds, yeah. 
Austin: They get like- they get like, sucked into the staff for a second, and that long, silver like, spiral around its- its body like, lights up and does this much damage to you [typing] which I’m sure you have a counter for. Or maybe you have some balance. I’m not sure if you do. But uh, does eight that ignores armor. 
Keith: It ignore- So, I have a move Shed. 
Austin: Yes. 
Keith: Uh, Shed. All I- All it does is I can at- When I take damage, I can just ignore the damage and de-transform. 
Austin: Right. So then, yeah. You get- you get blasted back, but you don’t do any- you don’t take any damage. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Like, you’re- be turn back into Fero. 
Keith: Uh hm. 
Austin: And then he like, slams his staff on the ground, and he says, 
Austin (as Arrell): You would- It would be best for you if you stayed that way, druid.
Keith (as Fero): I can do plenty this way. 
Austin (as Arrell): Why do you strike me when our goals are so similar? We both simply wish to survive. I’ve never understood you. I’ve made you an offer, and you did not even respond.
Keith (as Fero): I don’t think anyone’s done that good of a job of pinning me down. I don’t see why you would do any better. 
Austin (as Arrell): I am not offering to pin you down. I’m offering you a place to spread your wings. No more- [exhales] No more lords or decisions about who eats and who doesn’t. My dream is yours. A world where each of us, in our own, can create something fit for us. Something that reflects our ideas and our desires. Perfection, individualized. 
Austin: Benjamin is looking at you for guidance, Hadrian. 
Art: Oh, I was just typing in the- Hadrian has a hundred percent used this situation to get to the other side-
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Totally.
Art: -and is gonna- is gonna try to- is gonna Defend- 
Austin: Cool. You wanna roll-
Art: -Benjamin.
Austin: Ok. Do a-
Art: That is a roll?
Austin: Yeah, go ahead and roll Defend. That is a twelve. Hell yeah. 
Art: I just rolled constitution, but um, yeah, that’s it.
Austin: Oh wait. Wait, is it still? 2d6 plus- Is that what?
Art: Plus one, yeah. 
Austin: Oh, Defend is constitution. Gotcha. 
Art: Yeah. 
Austin: Yep. Perfect. 
Art: Defend is constitution. Um, so I get up to three hold, which I can use to redirect an attack from the thing I defend to myself, halve the attack’s effect or damage, open up the attacker to an ally, giving that ally-
Austin: Uh hm. 
Art: -plus one forward against the attacker, deal damage to the attacker equal to your level. And because of my Guadrian stuff, I also have the option, give your ward an opportunity to escape a dangerous situation. 
Keith: Nice. 
Austin: Cool. Do you spend that like, immediately? Or are you saving that?
Art: Um, I’m going to save it.
Austin: Ok. 
Art: Because there is no-
Austin: Yeah, there is no- You could sneak it in whenever. Totally. 
Art: Right. It’s- it’s- You use the hold when you’re- the thing you defend is attacked. 
Austin: Right. 
Art: So, I am going to let this situation continue, but that is-
Austin: Totally. 
Art: And Benjamin looks to me for guidance, and I- I do my best to communicate like- like, ‘just don’t like- unless’ and like, maybe I just like- we’re close enough I could whisper it like, 
Art (as Hadrian): Unless Fero gives you a window, don’t- just don’t. 
Austin: He lowers his hands just a little bit, but they’re still kind of glowing. And he’s like- he finds- Oh, uh, he again goes like- he says like, 
Austin (as Benjamin): [whispering] What if I make myself invisible? [Keith and Dre laugh hard] 
Art (as Hadrian): I really think he could see you.
Austin (as Benjamin): Fuck. I mean- Shit. Ah! [Keith laughs]
Art (as Hadrian): It’s fine. When there’s- when there’s a- when there’s- In this situation, it’s fine to swear. [Keith laughs hard again]
Austin (as Benjamin): Cool. Fuck. 
Art (as Hadrian): Ok, don’t go crazy. [Austin and Keith laugh hard] 
Austin: Um, [exhales] 
Austin (as Arrell): Do you really love them so much that you couldn’t bear to leave them, Fero? Come visit. See what I’ve built. 
Keith (as Fero): No- No.
Art (as Hadrian): Wait, but maybe yes. 
Austin: Is that Hadrian?! [Art laughs] 
Keith: Or is that Art?
Art: No, I think that’s- I think Hadrian. 
Keith: Who am I speaking to now?
Austin: Ok. 
[1:00:00]
Art (as Hadrian): Right? Like, just go and check it out right now. And then when you’re done, leave.
Keith (as Fero): Right now?
Art (as Hadrian): I mean, what are you doin’ right now?
Keith (as Fero): I mean, I want to get- be able to get back here. I have plans tomorrow. 
Art (as Hadrian): You- I thought you could get- You can’t get back?
Keith (as Fero): It’s so far away. It’s across the whole-
Austin (as Arrell): I could bring him back. 
Art (as Hadrian): Sure. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, but only if it goes well. [Austin laughs] 
Art (as Hadrian): But like, what’s the biggest bird you can- How- What’s the fastest bird you could be?
Austin: It’s far. It’s far. It’s farther than a day. 
Keith: It’s-
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: Yeah, it would-
Austin: If it’s the biggest- Uh-
Keith: Uh, going by different trips that we’ve had before, me as the fastest bird that I could be would still probably take a couple days to get here, at least. 
Austin: At least. 
Keith: I mean it’s as far away as any other point on the map. 
Austin: It’s the furthest away we’ve ever been. 
Keith: Yeah.
[crosstalking] 
Austin: And from Velas-
Keith: And then Velas is even further.
Austin: -twice that. Yeah. [laughs]
Keith: Yeah, exactly. 
Austin: Not twice cause that’s not how triangles work, but-
Keith: It would take a long time. It would take days.
Austin: Yeah, uh huh. 
Keith: Um, I- Yeah, I- you know-
Austin: And I have a morning farm appointment. [laughs] 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, I do. I have a mor- I have- I have a good idea, so-
Art (as Hadrian): Alright, if you have stuff, I’m not- I don’t want to- I don’t want to like, get in your way. I’m just- If you had time, maybe that would be a way to- we all get out of this right now. 
Keith (as Fero): His whole- I mean his whole fuckin’ thing- He sells cages by saying there’s no cages. It’s the wor- He’s a- he’s a-
Austin (as Arrell): I’ve never- There is a cage. It’s a very nice one, and it is better than the destruction of everything. 
Keith (as Fero): [overlapping] You just said no cages. See that’s what I’m saying. One, you take one look past the top level- He started the conversation by saying, ‘Fero, you can stretch your wings. There’s no cages.’ And then it’s like, ‘Ok, well it’s a nice cage.’
Austin (as Arrell): I said- I sell them. I didn’t put you in one. If you would like to purchase one-
Keith (as Fero): You put other people in one. You put him in one. 
Austin (as Arrell): I did, so that I may offer them to more. And in fact, I did with Benjamin on request. It was a favor for Hadrian. 
Keith (as Fero): [shouting] I fuckin’ knew it!
Art (as Hadrian): [yelling] It’s cause of you, asshole!
Keith (as Fero): I’m just saying I knew it. I had- if it was- We had a fight. I had a fight with Throndir about this. 
Art (as Hadrian): Well, I wasn’t there for that. I did it because you were like, ‘who fuckin’ cares if Velas gets destroyed?’
Keith (as Fero): No, no, I’m not mad at you. I’m mad at Throndir.
Austin (as Arrell): You all have a very interesting relationship. I will be seeing myself out now. Hadrian, if you mean well by it, I’ll be here tomorrow. 
Art (as Hadrian): I will do exactly what I said. 
Austin (as Arrell): Tomorrow then. 
Austin: And like, nods to you and then slams his staff on the ground, and with a blast of flame, vanishes.
Art (as Hadrian): Yo, we got to get to Tabard right now. [Austin laughs] 
Austin: Tabard in the lounge right now [Austin and Sylvia laugh] just on that blueberry hookah. Um-
Dre: [imitating Tabard] ‘No, Throndir. You have to hold it in.’ [Austin laughs hard] 
Austin: Um, so yeah. Do you- I’m guessing y’all run to- Do y’all- do y’all call like, a brief counsel back in the-?
Art: I- Or like, a medium length council?
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Keith: Yeah, I think so. 
Art: Yeah, I think- This feels like an all hands on deck meeting, if- if that’s a-
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: -that’s a thing they do here. 
Austin: It’s an all hands on deck meeting. Which means actually- Oh, ok. So, wait. Is it an all hands on deck meeting?
Art: It’s- We’ll tell Tabard like, the short of it. But he can decide how many hands are gonna be at the meeting. 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. 
Keith: How far is the deck?
Austin: It’s just down- it’s the kitchen again. 
Keith: It’s the kitchen. Ok. 
Austin: It’s where you ate dinner before. Um, now there’s like a nice, evening drink being served which I think all the pala-din- or- or Tabard is also drinking. He just like sits in there, and then it kind of like, porously moves through your body. It’s nice. Anyway, 
Austin (as Tabard): What is the- what is the- the emergency?
Austin: Everyone is here. Unless someone doesn’t want to be here.
Art (as Hadrian): Do- do you know- do you know Arrell?
Austin: Shakes his head. 
Austin (as Tabard): No.
Art (as Hadrian): Oh, see. 
Austin (as Tabard): Arrell.
Art (as Hadrian): That’s one- He’s at- he’s at one lie on this trip then. Um, well, we do. We know Arrell. [Art laughs lightly] 
Keith: Brag. [laughs] Sorry. 
Art (as Hadrian): A- Arrell is um- See, I was gonna say wizard, and he said that’s not right.
Keith (as Fero): Oh, lich. He’s a lich. 
Art (as Hadrian): It’s a lich?
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Art (as Hadrian): He’s a lich?
Keith (as Fero): I was talk- I talked to Galenica again, and Galenica said that um, he’s a lich. 
Austin (as Tabard): You talked to Galenica?
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, in the hallway. 
Art (as Hadrian): We really can’t get distracted by this. [Austin laughs] 
[1:05:00]
Austin (as Tabard): This party is unbelievable. 
Austin: I think- God, yeah. At the mention of Arrell and the wizard- the wizard- He says, um, 
Austin (as Tabard): The wizard, of- who traveled with you. Uh, Fantasmo. Is Arrell his full name? Or his old name? Or a new name?
Art (as Hadrian): No, Fantasmo was like an elaborate lie to trick us. Arrell is less good. [Dre/Throndir makes ‘mmm’ noise] And then became decidedly worse.
Austin (as Tabard): Hm. 
Art (as Hadrian): And- and is the ruler of Velas right now. 
Austin (as Tabard): I see. Heard strange things about Velas. 
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah, it’s not great.
Keith (as Fero): Oh, what did you hear? That’s interesting. We don’t know much about it cause we’ve been sort of fighting with him. 
Austin (as Tabard): I’ve heard it is too quiet. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, that sounds right. 
Austin (as Tabard): Heard that he has- or I’ve heard that Velas has a great deal of magic. Is protected by shields of star un- not unlike what I’ve heard about the university. But they do not trade with us despite an ocean route that would be very easy, at least until recent events. And there has been little in the way of parley. 
Art (as Hadrian): Well, um, he was here just now. 
Austin: I think like, Highwater and Marigold immediately like, reach for weapons. 
Sylvia: Same. 
Art (as Hadrian): Gone now.
Keith (as Fero): He’s gone. 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Oh. 
Art (as Hadrian): Gonna come back tomorrow. So like, keep those weapons handy. I’ll-
Keith (as Fero): For a- for a meeting?
Art (as Hadrian): I mean we’re gonna meet him. 
Austin: Rosana asks, 
Austin (as Rosana): What does he want?
Art (as Hadrian): He wants- and everyone wait for the end of this- He wants an army of pala-din that he’s gonna make, and again, with wizard-lich magic, and he’s gonna- he’s gonna take that, and he’s gonna march it down to the City of First Light. And then I presume just everywhere else. 
Austin (as Benjamin): He also said-
Keith: Wait, hold on. Didn’t he say- Yeah, didn’t he say that-
Austin: Benjamin. You weren’t there yet for this, Fero, but Benjamin was, right?
Keith: Oh no, I was out of character.
Austin: Yeah, oh. Oh. 
Keith: I was not there yet. 
Austin: Benjamin says, 
Austin (as Benjamin): And also he wants to put people in them because they’re better at the Spring. He said it was his backup plan.
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah, I was less clear about that. Um, yeah. He’s gonna- he’s gonna put people inside them. Like a reverse Tabard, kinda. 
Austin: Tabard like sh- looks at you like, squints and shakes his head like, ‘why would you say that?’ [Keith and Austin laugh] And Rosana’s like, 
Austin (as Rosana): Ugh. Yeah.
Austin (as Tabard): He’s dangerous then?
Art (as Hadrian): Very much so. 
Austin (as Tabard): [exhales] We can have guards prepared. 
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah, I- I don’t think- There’s not too few guards for this. Er, too many. There’s not too many, is that what it would be?
Austin (as Tabard): Why would he not simply destroy the library with whoever we push in- put into it?
Keith (as Fero): He’s not that kind of guy. 
Art (as Hadrian): He might be. 
Keith (as Fero): I- I turned into a bear and I-
Austin (as Tabard): How did he get here?
Keith (as Fero): Magic. 
Art (as Hadrian): I don’t think we should worry about that. 
Austin (as Tabard): I- I believe-
Art (as Hadrian): He’s very powerful as a wizard. 
Austin (as Tabard): Could he- wha- Do I need to- Where is he now?
Art (as Hadrian): Somewhere else?
Austin (as Tabard): We- I need to- Uh-
Austin: And you know, he calls for a guard. Let’s see. Name really quick. He says, 
Austin (as Tabard): Kaleena? Triple the duty at the forge, at the statue. And if anything happens, you call to us. If he is here for the plans to the pala-din, he could learn where they are and take them at will. 
Art (as Hadrian): That’s a great point. And in retrospect, there are people we shouldn’t have brought here.
Austin (as Tabard): What do you mean? Who?
Keith: [in background] Boy. 
Art (as Hadrian): No, I just meant to like, this meeting. This is a very intense meeting. 
Austin: Benjamin says like, 
Austin (as Benjamin): I can leave if you need me to. 
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah, I just think this might be a lot for you. 
Austin: Rosana says like, 
[1:10:00]
Austin (as Rosana): I’m going to go with him. Tabard, can we all have additional guards on us? If- if this Arrell is around, then any of us could be targets.
Austin: And Tabard says, 
Austin (as Tabard): Of course. Kaleena, also, extra guards for our guests.
Sylvia: Also gonna- Cause we’re all there, right?
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: I’m also gonna offer Marigold and Highwater to help protect-
Austin: Ok, cool. 
Sylvia: -Rosana and yeah. 
Austin (as Rosana): Thank you. 
Austin: Says Rosana.
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Of course. 
Keith (as Fero): For what it’s worth, I do think it’s unlikely that Arrell will try to come back before the meeting tomorrow. He’s-
Austin (as Tabard): What is your reasoning?
Keith (as Fero): He seems more interested in manipulating people and striking deals than making enemies. Though it- by default, he tends to make them wherever he goes anyway. And for good reason, but he hasn’t done a lot of like, wanton murdering. 
Dre (as Throndir): Hm. 
Keith (as Fero): Is that not true?
Dre (as Throndir): I guess it’s- I guess it’s how you define wanton. 
Keith (as Fero): Um, and his goals now are different than his goals during his you know, arguably wanton murdering from before. 
Austin (as Tabard): I see. He went through his phase. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Tabard): That gives me ease. 
Art (as Hadrian): I don’t think he respects us enough to betray us. If that makes any sense.
Dre (as Throndir): No.
Keith (as Fero): I just don’t think he gains anything from betraying.
Austin: I do just want to say Rosana, Benjamin, Marigold, and Highwater have left at this point. Per that previous bit. I just want to be a hundred percent clear on that. 
Keith (as Fero): Like, be as protective as you be, but also um, you know. I don’t think- I don’t think there’s a danger until he’s back. And I don’t think that he will back until tomorrow when he said. 
Dre (as Throndir): Is there a more secure place you could move the pala-din plans to?
Austin (as Tabard): [exhales] Uh, security is such a strange word when you talk about a man who can appear and disappear at will. But yes, we should move them. Anywhere else would probably be safer now.
Keith: Does- Out of character, does Arrell know where the plans are? I don’t think so, right?
[heavy crosstalking]
Dre: Well, we just-
Austin: He does now.
Dre: -said the forge. Yeah. While Benjamin was here.
Austin: Yeah. He said in front-
Art: He said the forge while Benjamin was in the room. 
Austin: -was in the room, yeah. 
Keith: Oh ok. Alright. 
Austin: Yeah. Um, [light laugh] Yeah, that did happen. I think uh- Tabard is like, 
Austin (as Tabard): We don’t keep a standing army, so to speak. There is no garrison. 
Keith (as Fero): Will it-
Austin (as Tabard): Perhaps the bottom of the sea.
Dre (as Throndir): What?
Austin (as Tabard): We ride out on a boat, and we drop ‘em. And they wait. [pause] And I will be flayed for this decision. And frankly, I like what little bit of skin I have left.  But he wouldn’t find them, and we could retrieve them at some later time. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, I mean, make sure that- just you know, you and a couple guards are the only people that know where they are. 
Austin (as Tabard): I would not trust anyone who was not in this room, if this lich is so manipulative and powerful. Frankly, I’m frustrated that such a foe was drawn here in the first place. 
Keith (as Fero): Sorry. 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): I hate to say it, but if his plans are what they say that- what he says they are, he would have come here regardless. I think the fact that we’ve got any form of warning with someone as dangerous as him is the only silver lining we’ve got here. 
Austin (as Tabard): You’re probably right. [sighs] Alright. Who is going to help me move these plates? The blue prints. We need to do this now. 
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah, definitely. 
Dre (as Throndir): I can. Hadrian, you should- you should go be with Benjamin. 
Austin (as Tabard): Alright, Throndir and uh, Ephrim, come with me. 
Austin: And um, he leads you to the statue where there are already like, a dozen more guards, obviously. Maybe even more than that. You and um- I actually think he says, 
[1:15:00]
Austin (as Tabard): You may want to put your masks on. 
Austin: The- There is dust in the air, and it is like, even with the masks on, you get a little buzzed. [light laugh] 
Dre: Do I- Actually, now that I think about, do I need a mask if I don’t breathe?
Austin: I guess maybe not- Uh, it’s up to you. 
Dre: I mean, I’ll wear it anyway. 
Austin: Yeah. The stuff here would affect you, even if you didn’t have- even you is the thing- 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: -is what I will say.
Dre: Fair.
Austin: This is like, the dust of Galenica. So, it’s weird. Like, um, Galenica’s forge is weird. There’s- there’s positives and negatives to it is what I will say. In any case, leads you down into this kind of like, pit below the statue that’s been dug out. And there’s all these little like, small workshops dug into the side of the walls. And eventually leads you to a place that is not particularly descript. Like, it’s not like the center of power or anything like that. But um, produces these three heavy plates, and they’re made of like, an ancient metal that you don’t understand really. And you can see that that they’re blueprints, but they also clearly like, interlock into some sort of machinery. And that is how they build new pala-din. And he’s like, 
Austin (as Tabard): Kaleena. 
Austin: And the- you know, she says like, 
Austin (as Kaleena): A boat is being prepared, sir. 
Austin: And brings you to a dock to- off the eastern shore here. And the three of you load onto that boat and push off, and it’s like a- a row boat basically. And you begin to row away. And you get pretty far out, and then in the middle of the night, the bells start ringing again. I’m gonna spend that other hunger. 
Dre: Ah, that’s- that’s pretty fucked up, Austin. But fair. 
Austin: Um, and it- This isn’t- And I think they start to ring, and I think Tabard says, 
Austin (as Tabard): This shouldn’t-
Austin: He says like, 
Austin (as Tabard): But it’s not morning.
Austin: And um, what’s- what are the things I can do here? Oh, yeah. Here we go. I’m gonna spend that hunger to make you attack the nearest or weakest creature.
Dre: Uh hm. 
Austin: You- Which one- Do you think Tabard or Ephrim is nearer or weaker to you?
Dre: Hm. 
Sylvia: I am sick right now. [Dre laughs]
Austin: You are sick right now.
Dre: Yeah, I think you have to pick, Austin. 
Austin: Yeah, I guess I was- It’s Ephrim. It’s Ephrim. Uh, make your attack roll. Your Hack and Slash. 
Dre: Am I just like jumping with my fists?
Austin: You tell me. Uh, I don’t know. What do you this reads like? What does the vampire compelled by their hunger to attack the nearest or weakest creature look like to you? 
Dre: Mm. 
Austin:  For me, I wonder if it’s Apex Predator. 
Dre: Oh gosh. [quietly] Here it is. Oh. Yeah.
Austin: Like, is this you’re feeding? Do you know what I mean?
Dre: Oh boy. Yeah. 
Austin: Like you’re driven by hunger to feed basically. 
Dre: Uh hm. 
Austin: Cause I don’t think it’s a ‘you pull out your gun.’ That doesn’t seem-
Dre: Yeah, no. No, not at all. 
Austin: You know?
Dre: Ok, yeah. [laughs] So, that’s a- 
Austin: What is that?
Dre: -plus DEX if I’m using stealth or aggression.
Austin: Oh, yeah. So, there you go. 2d6 plus- plus DEX,
Keith: Can’t this kill Ephrim?
Austin: We’ll see.
Dre: Hold on. 
Sylvia: You know. 
Dre: Double checking here. Just to make sure there isn’t something I can do-
Austin: I mean it’s a Hack and-
Dre: Is it-
Austin: -it could basically be a Hack and Slash roll, right?
Dre: No, I’m just making sure that I-
Austin: That you don’t have like, a backup?
Dre: Ok, the only way I could resist a weakness is to spend a vigor. Which I don’t have.
Austin: Right, which you don't have any of right now cause you don’t feed on people ever. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: At least you lose this hunger. 
Dre: True. Alright, what am I rolling here? What did we decide?
Austin: DEX. 2d6 plus DEX.
Dre: Ok. 
Austin: That’s a ten. 
Dre: That’s a ten. 
Austin: So-
Sylvia: Alright. 
Austin: -do your damage, but then also take two vigor, basically. Um-
Dre: Um, actually-
Austin: Or do you not do damage because of this?
Dre: Apex predator doesn’t do damage.
Austin: So, then what’s this- but what’s this feel like then? If it is still an attack? What does that look and feel like to Ephrim?
Dre: Hm. If the way we’ve kind of talked about like, Hieron vampires before have been more about kind of like, feelings and life force-
Austin: Yeah. 
Dre: -rather than like, physical like, blood-
Austin: Uh hm. 
Dre: Uh… I don’t- I- It probably does some real bad things to Ephrim’s arm. 
Austin: Oh, interesting. Do you think it reopens the wound?
Dre: Yeah, probably. 
Austin: Fuck. [groaning] Ohhhhh. 
Dre: Like, I don’t know- you- you tell me.
Austin: No, I like it. 
Dre: But-
Sylvia: I like it, too. 
Austin: What’s- Yeah. Uh huh. 
Dre: Seems like the most- [laughs]
Austin: Fuck. 
Sylvia: It’s cool.
Dre: Seems like the most honest thing. 
Austin: Um, so here’s what I’ll say though, Ephrim lose one hit point permanently. 
Sylvia: Alright. 
Austin: So, nine- You’re down to nineteen HP now. Um-
[1:20:00]
Keith: Austin hates Sylvia’s hit points.
Austin: Just hate ‘em. [Dre laughs]
Sylvia: You know what? It’s- it’s fine. I accept it. 
Austin: And then, here’s the other thing. I need you to take um, either confused or stunned cause this is that like, that feeling of being- You were already sick, and now you are-
Sylvia: I’ll take confused, I think. 
Austin: Ok. Take confused.
Sylvia: I think it’s more just like, what the hell just happened?
Austin: What- So, yeah. What does- what does this look like? Does the bell ring and then nothing happens basically? You just sit in place, but you feel that you’re feeding on Ephrim?
Dre: I wonder if it’s like, the bell rings. Throndir like, stumbles. Ephrim goes to catch him, and then their eyes meet. And it’s very, a short eye meeting, but it is a very intense look. 
Austin: Yeah. And I think we get Tabard saying like, 
Austin (as Tabard): Hey, the- the bell rang, and you didn’t- Maybe it wasn’t the bell at all.
Austin: Um, and then we get a shot of Arrell near the bells. And his gaze is in fact, not on the boat. It is on the statue where he anticipates that you will start losing it and freaking out and hurting people or fleeing or making a distraction for him to quickly retrieve these plates. But you’re not there at all cause you moved more quickly than he could. And he’s like, ready to pounce the second he see your gun go off or the second he hears someone scream. You know, he’s on the top of like, a bell tower basically. But the pala-din keep to their- to their patrol routes, and he doesn’t get the opportunity he wanted. Ephrim, do you know? Or does this just feel bad?
Sylvia: I think-
Austin: I guess part of that question is also with Thron- Throndir, do people- I guess you succeeded, right? So-
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: So, I think-
Dre: So, part of the success is that people are supposed to be-
Austin: Right. 
Dre: -undisturbed. 
Austin: Undisturbed, yeah. Yeah. So, yeah. So, maybe it’s no, but Ephrim do you know you feel bad? [light laugh] 
Sylvia: I think Ephrim has more noticed that like, the wound has reopened- 
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: -on his arm basically, and that’s what’s confused him and like, stunned him. He’s not entirely sure what’s going on with Throndir. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: Um, so yeah. I’d say he’s not aware that it was an attack- 
Austin: Right. 
Sylvia: -really. 
Austin: Um, but Throndir, you’re aware of what you did. 
Dre: Uh hm. 
Austin: Ok. Take two vigor, by the way. Nice work. 
Dre: Oh, I did. Yeah.
Austin: You could take- you could take a third if you if you want to kill a healthy person, but-
Dre: Nah, I’m good. 
Austin: Ok. 
Dre: I’m good. 
Sylvia: You sure?
Austin: Ok. 
Dre: Nah, I’m good. 
Austin: Ok. 
Dre: I don’t know. You want to be a vampire? It’s pretty sick. [Austin laughs] 
Austin: Um, you get out far enough, and Tabard says, 
Austin (as Tabard): This is- this should do. 
Austin: Um, and lifts the first of these big, heavy plates up and like, flings it over the edge. 
[Jack de Quidt’s “Something” begins playing in the background] 
And then helps y’all with the other two. It’s not that far off. You know, it was like, a twenty five minute small sailboat ride. And he says, 
Austin (as Tabard): There’s a bright path of coral here. We won’t forget it. 
Austin: And turns back to head back toward town. 
[Music finishes playing out] 
[1:25:00]
