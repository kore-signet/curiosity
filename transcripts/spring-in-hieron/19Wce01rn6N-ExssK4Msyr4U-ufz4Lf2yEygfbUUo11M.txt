SPRING IN HIERON 16: MUSIC THROUGH A WALL
Transcriber: Cole
(Recap)
Austin: For a moment, it is as if nearly everything hangs in the air. A number of the Mistral, members of the border control hunting down the terrorist Quill, stop in flight and stare not at their adversaries, but up into the sky. The three of you, as well, are frozen in place. As are the members of the Quill themselves scattered below on the beaches. All throughout the island of Deya and in fact, all across all of the Isles of Flight, it is as if everything is frozen in place, except of course, for the moon Del, which is descending rapidly towards you. 
Keith (as Fero): You killed that guy! [Ali laughs] You just killed that guy! 
Ali (as Hella): [laughing throughout] All of the people that I know have so much [inaudible]
Keith (as Fero): [overlapping] I said... the moon started falling, and I said ‘What should we do?’ And you… you didn’t say a word. You picked up a bottle, turned around, and threw it at maybe the first person you saw! I did [laughs]
Ali (as Hella): [laughing throughout] Listen, I’m stressed. They’re going to the beach. We have to go to that beach. 
Keith (as Fero): Do you know that guy?
Austin: So you… Hella throws this, and then you’re headin’ down to the… to the… climbing down this cliff, going to the beach.
Keith: I don’t… I don’t know that I’ve decided what to do. 
 [Jack de Quidt’s “Something” begins playing in the background]
Austin (as Jazella): Lem King, I do not know you and you do not know me or my people. You propose a… a terrible day is coming. Consider…
Austin: She can’t say ‘for once’. She doesn’t know you that well.
Austin (as Jazella): Consider that for many, the worst is behind them. And even if all we do is busy the time between now and the end of… the end of days with the work of creating a new, better world? Those days will be better than any that came before. When we are done, and we’ve rebuilt things, we would be happy to speak with you on a further basis. 
Ali (as Hella): Oh, yeah. Absolutely. Sorry, you’re turbo busy. Um, but…
Keith (as Fero): With the moon thing. 
Ali (as Hella): Uh huh.
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Ali (as Hella): Your hands are super full, but we like, live in a giant library, and I was talking to that weird cop guy about how the whole magic thing works. If there’s knowledge that we had, if there was someone who wanted to come back with us…  
Austin: She’s like, 
Austin (as Jazella): Yes. There was uh, Xeralia. Xeralia. Brilliant mind. Xeralia could go with you, pending her acceptance, of course. Or could join you later perhaps. And perhaps she could find a way to return what was taken from us. 
Ali (as Hella): That would be amazing. Yeah, yeah, yeah. If there’s a way that we could help… Yeah. 
Keith (as Fero): Lem, do you remember when you stole that thing that was really useful to you from the New Archives?
Jack (as Lem): Yeah. It… it began a series of events that… you know, kind of ruined my life. 
Keith (as Fero): Yes. I want to steal something from the New Archives.
Jack (as Lem): Please don’t.
Keith (as Fero): I don’t know that there’s a system to really get me in trouble for that anymore. 
Jack (as Lem): Well, you can’t just steal something from the Archives. 
Keith (as Fero): And there’s about to be a wave that hit it, and I feel like, actually, I’m rescuing something from the New Archives. 
Austin: Hmm.
Jack (as Lem): Right. Look. 
[Music plays out to end]
Jack (as Lem): Ok, Fero. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Jack (as Lem): Ok, right. I didn’t want to tell you this because you’d say something like, that’s bullshit. But we had an aviary where we kept lots of different kinds of birds. Live birds. Mostly live birds. Uh, and some of them flew about, you know, on their own. And some of them were kept in little cages. 
Keith (as Fero): Like a pavillion. 
Jack (as Lem): And… right. Like a pavillion. [sighs] And there was a whole department of people to feed the birds and you know, see what they did. And one of these… one of these birds, like a small… like a little bird. It does the thing that you want. Like an amulet. 
Keith (as Fero): Ok. Got it. 
Jack (as Lem): But, it was...it’s a bird, Fero. I don’t know who has been feeding it. I don’t know… I don’t even know if it’s still… I don’t know if the-
Keith (as Fero): It can find its own food. It’s a bird. 
Jack (as Lem): Well, it’s trapped in the aviary. 
Keith (as Fero): I’ll let it out. I’ll help it. It’s sounds… now this is a mission to rescue a bird. We gotta let these birds out. All of them. Or they’re gonna get killed by the wave.
Jack (as Lem): Oh no, not all of them. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, we have to let all those birds out.
Jack (as Lem): There’s some other birds in there. No, we really don’t want to let some of those birds out, Fero. 
Keith (as Fero): We… Are there any other animal sections? Or is there a zoo? We have to free the zoo animals. [Ali sighs] And I have to keep one of them. [Jack, Keith, and Austin laugh]
Jack: We have to free all the birds, except mine. 
Ali (as Hella): Fero, you can… you talk to birds, you could just ask if it wants to come chill with you, right? Yeah.
Keith (as Fero): Yes. I will ask it. 
Ali (as Hella): Fero?
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. I’ll ask it. 
Ali (as Hella): Ok. 
Keith (as Fero): You can watch me ask it. 
Ali (as Hella): I totally do... [pause] want to. [Keith laughs]
Austin: Ok. I was like, ‘Wait. Did we jump cut? Did I miss... to us being…?’ [Ali and Jack laugh] So, here’s a real question. Are… Have… Can I just reframe this entire past scene? I have a question.
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Have you left the Isles of Flight or have you been… did all that conversation happen, and in the background you’ve been like, prepping the sandbags on the side of this floating liner? 
Keith: Yes. Yeah, that’s exactly it. 
Jack: I love it because it’s like… it’s like the… It’s like when you’re on a journey, and you’re debating taking a detour…
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: ...and the road for the detour is getting closer and closer…
Austin:  Yes.
Jack: And you’re like, ‘Look, we have to decide if we’re gonna go here, you know, soon or else we’re gonna pass the exit.’ 
Keith: Well, the good news is that I’m not gonna be in that glide bucket. So, I can do whatever I want. 
Austin: God damnit. 
Keith: Do we want to invite anybody with us?
Ali:  I… I think that’s the thing cause like, I think before… This is happening in the city, but I think that we… when we left the cave, we were like, ‘Hey if that person wants to come… where we… [inaudible]
Austin: Yeah, I think they’re gonna come later. They’re gonna stay. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: Like, they’re in the middle of their thing. Right?
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: LIke, I… I want to be...
Jack: The revolution is still happening. 
Austin:  Yeah. 
Jack: Right? Like you’re not gonna like, bunk off the revolution at the end. 
Austin: They’re not gonna be like, ‘Oh, our best scientist and magician should leave right now.’
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: You know? Like, they’re gonna hold onto their mage, and then afterwards…
Keith: Well, what about their most cowardly scientist or magician? [Austin and Jack laugh]
Austin: Um, you know… you know, I think there’s probably people who would be willing to do it, but I also...
Keith: No, no. it’s-
Austin: Yeah. Especially not now that you’re making a stop at the fucking New Archives aviary. Um, so I think I need. Here’s what I need. Who is piloting this? Is this Hella?
Ali: Might as well. Can I just say on recording really quick? Can I just like, leave a card with them, in that case then? Maybe like....
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Ali: Yeah, just… Ok. 
Keith: Do you have like, business cards? [Ali laughs]
Austin: I don’t think so. 
Jack: The Last University. South.
Austin: They know where it is. 
Keith: Representative of-
Austin: Right. I’m not gonna make the thing where it’s like, ‘And then they never… you never heard from them again cause you didn’t say where you were.’
Ali: Right. 
Austin: ‘Got him.’ 
Ali: I just feel like, if they come there and Hella’s not home, I just want it to be cool. But it’s fine.
Austin: Yeah. Um, ok. So, you um, yeah… You should pilot this thing. God, what is it like to pilot an airship?
Ali: Sick, I bet. I [laughs]
Austin: How do you pilot the boat? Did we have a move for that? Was just Defy Danger?
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: I think it was Defy Danger.
Keith: Well it was… It was the dangerous journey thing is what we did.
Austin: Yeah, well no, that was to… that was like, the way up here for… I don’t want to do a whole nother Defy Danger… it was… part of the deal was like, the way down with the boat, y’all don’t have to do a defy… perilous journey again.
Keith: Uh huh. 
Ali: Yeah.
Austin: Um, so this is just like to get to that part of the New Archives. 
Ali: Ok.
Austin: Which… Go ahead. 
Ali: I just want to say before I roll this and it might turn around, this past like, three hours has been the best day of Hella’s life after having a really shitty day. [Austin and Ali laugh] I think it’s like, if Fero isn’t on the ship or whatever, and just flying beside it, and I think she’s like, really happy and like, telling him about all this other like, shitty magic stuff...
Austin: Uh huh.
Ali: ...that she’s found. And that’s why she was like, 
Ali (as Hella): I said amulet because I’ve done that before. 
Ali: And is just like, going over like…
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: ...old missions that she’s been part of.
Austin: Yeah. I think like, let’s just put a cherry on it. There’s definitely a point at which you like, basically feel like a magical kiss on the cheek or forehead… forehead. That is just like very brief… Like, ‘Wait, what?’ That is like… almost like an invoice being sent back to you. Like, ‘Yep, got him.’ And I think Adelaide tells you that like, she’s getting ready for a very busy day because lots of people are going to be coming because of the moon. Um, and she’s gonna do her best to hold those people back, but also she is… most of them are not going to be able to be saved because there’s too many of them, right?
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: So…
Keith: And we’re not there anymore. 
Austin: And you’re not… you’re not there anymore, right? And like, eventually maybe there will be a church of her, and other people can do this rite, but that hasn’t happened yet, so… you know. Bit by bit. 
Ali: [laughs] I can’t… a bunch of like, weird assholes being massacred on a moon…
Austin: Right, I’m not sayin’...
Ali: I was considering going out there and being like, let me just figure some stuff out, but also…
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. Actually, here’s a question. Do you teach the prayer to like, uh whichever the Urrn, Oorn, Aarns were with you. 
Ali: Oh yeah. I would super love to. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: I didn’t get a chance to say it before, but I would have loved to have been like, ‘Hey, is there a room of sick people or do you have like, a church?’
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Or like a… 
Austin: I think… even if that’s not the case, where you don’t necessarily like… you know what? Let’s say that there were. Let’s say that like, yeah. Listen, some people in the revolution got hurt and were dying. And you know, we’re painting from pretty broad brushes here today because we want to get through a lot. But like, I totally think there was time for Hella to have been like, last rites on some people and to teach that prayer to some folks there. To like, start spreading. 
Ali: Yeah. I think, like, in this specific case, it’s like, her going into the infirmary and being like, you know, the thing that you did is a brave thing and kind of doing a sermon. And then being like, if you can carry these words to other people… you know. It is what it is. 
Austin: Yeah. Totally. 
Ali: You know. 
Austin: Totally. Totally. Totally. [Ali laughs] Um, cool. Um, alright, so give me… I think… Are you… hmm… Let’s talk about boats and sky boats. 
Ali: Please let me be good at this so I can keep this fucking boat. [laugh] Um… Is this a… 
Austin: Um… I don’t think it’s strength. That feels wrong. 
Ali: Yeah. The… the way that I’ve always thought of Hella piloting stuff is that it’s always either like, dex or constitution. 
Austin: Hmm.
Ali: Because it is either, having the strength to…
Austin: Like, the…
Ali: …hold your hands steady. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: And like…
Austin: Like the endurance?
Ali: Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I think especially in something like this, in being in the sky and like… the wind is a crossover, right? But like, to be able to not like, lean into…
Austin: Yeah. Yeah.
Ali: ...the weird wind gaze or like, having the strength to like, not flinch when there’s like, a weird thing that happens and you’re in the sky. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: ...is constitution to me. 
Austin: And I think doing that… yeah, I think doing that quickly to like, dodge out of the way would maybe be strength.
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: But… but um, given the idea of like, ‘Oh, yeah. You’re keeping it straight over the course of a journey.’ is constitution. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: So give me… Give me Defy Danger con, which is plus 2. Oh my god. 
Ali: Oh my god. How is that possible? I got 2 ones plus two. 
Austin: You got a… you got a 4. So, what’s this like like? Fucking god. I know what it looks like. 
Keith: I can’t… I can’t even assist. I would assist. I can’t assist. 
Austin: No, you can’t. You couldn’t possibly. 
Ali: I talk such a big game, and I had such high hopes. 
Austin: Yeah. Fero…
Jack: It’s… it’s the Hella...
Ali: I said specifically that I’m in a good mood. 
Keith: Yeah.
Jack: Hella, I can fly. I can pilot a boat. Narrator voice, she couldn’t [Austin, Keith, and Ali laugh]
Austin: So, Fero, you’re some sort of bird. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Do you want to roll for this? What type of bird are you?
Keith: Sure. Let’s um… let’s go sprangaroo. 
Austin: Let’s… Give me the sprangaroo roll. What’s your plus on this? This is wisdom, right?
Keith: This is wisdom, yeah. Let me get... my thing got closed. Ok. 
Austin: Uh, you got plus 3 wis. That’s an 11. 
Keith: Yeah. That’s the best. Well…
[crosstalking]
Austin: It’s… it’s almost the best. 
Keith: If I would have got one more, there would have been a lot of sprangaroos.
Austin: If you had one more, it would have been a bunch of sprangaroos. You’re right. 
Keith: But… but there is… there is a sort of… There’s a sort of like relief…
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: ...in not having a thing that populates the world so I can’t wipe them all out. 
Austin: That’s [laughs] That’s true. Um, so…
Keith: This has like a... I just keep coming up with new birds every time I get… every time I fill the world with them.
Austin: Uh huh. You see the aviary. What’s the aviary look like from above, Lem?
Jack: Um, it’s… um, [sighs] I’m trying to think about, like, cause we’ve talked about the architecture of the New Archives before, and I really don’t want to just say, like, ‘It’s a big glass building.’
Austin: Uh huh. 
Jack: Um, I think it’s… I think it’s… a sort of a…. It’s like, cloisters almost. 
Austin: Hmm.
Jack: Or like, um, you know like, long greenhouses? Long, glass greenhouses, rather than you know, like big ones? Like industrial greenhouses almost. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Um, and I think you know, broken glass. And uh, you know, water damage and things. Yeah, if you look at like, industrial greenhouses, I think that’s probably what I’m thinking of. 
Austin: Cool. I like that idea. So, there are… a second question. What’s that look like as you’re crashing into it? In an airship?
Jack: [exhales] Sharp, right? Sharp, probably. 
Keith: It’d look sharp.
Jack: Probably I think glass is one of the worst things to fall onto. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: Um… So, I guess I don’t have to worry about letting the birds out. 
Jack: Well, [laughs] remember how Hella was saying this had been the best day of her life so far?
Austin: Uh huh. 
Jack: I think Lem is experiencing ___
Keith: On screen, that would have happened about 5 seconds before the crash part.
[crosstalk] [Keith laughs throughout]
Austin: Oh yeah. 
Jack: Uh huh. 
Austin:; Just…[foley] ‘Ka-choo’
Jack: I think… I think...
Austin:  ‘Crack’. Just like….
[0:15:00]
Keith: This is like in Titanic when they’re doing the king of the world scene, and if he falls into the ocean right then, the movie’s over. [laughs]
Austin: Oh god. Yeah, that’s it. Uh… the boat…
Jack: I think…
Austin: Er, go ahead. 
Jack: Oh, I think Lem’s just feeling that unique cocktail of emotions of plummeting very quickly towards one of your previous worst mistakes. 
Austin: Uh huh. Literally in this case. 
Jack: Um, so it’s just… it’s just bad... 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: …any way you cut it. 
Austin: Um, the wind is just too much for you, and you… you know, maybe in the back of your mind, like, ‘Probably is the moon is falling. That probably fucked up the whole wind situation.’ But like, that might not be it either. It might just be that it’s hard to pilot this big glider that’s an experimental glider also, you know? 
Ali: [laughs] Ok. 
Austin: Like, this is not built for this already. Um, and you did it anyway. And you like, are trying to land… you’re trying to like, come down next to this thing. Um, there’s like, some empty space. Also, like, yeah. The Archives partially flooded already. There’s stuff that’s been destroyed. Stuff has clearly been looted already. Um, it’s-
Jack: Just like little groups of people moving. Very small.
Austin: Very small, um, you know... Way off in the distance you can see a couple of small villages towards the outskirts. But like, you can also definitely see… there are people who are wearing armor and like, are maybe rival bandit gangs. Or rival gangs of people here. Um, this place… it’s also overgrown. Like, completely overgrown with the new flora. The spring. 
Keith: Does it look like any of the bandits have been taking care of the birds?
Austin: So, we’ll see. Um, what it does look like as you crash into this greenhouse, uh aviary… One, a bunch of birds fly away because of the crash. And there is just like, a cacophonous like, [foley] ‘mwaaah’ sound. And then two, like, you crash. So like, I’m gonna roll some damage real quick. Just roll 1d6 for both of you. Actually, I’m gonna roll d8. You crashed a fucking thing.
Keith: This would have been such a good thing to keep.
Austin: That’s Hella…. That”s Lem. Hella, take 5 damage. Lem take 3 damage. 
Ali: Oh. 
Jack: Does this ignore armor?
Austin: This ignores armor. You’ve crashed a…
Ali: Oh I…
Keith: You what?
Austin: Uh huh. You what?
Ali: I can take 5 damage. I’m good.
Austin: Yeah, you’ll be fine. You’re at 26. Also, this airship is just destroyed. Is just… the, you know, the balloon part of it gets caught on some glass. One of the sails, which I hadn’t mentioned before gets soaked in some… like, a water pond. LIke, it’s just destroyed. It’s just wrecked. Um, and the two of you are like, thrown from it. You land outside. You’re bruised. You know, maybe you have some… some… a sprain or something, but you’re alright. 
Jack: Hella took 5 damage. She’s fine. 
Austin: She’s fine. How much… how much HP do you have Lem?
Jack: I have 17 total. 
Austin: Ok. Um...
Keith: Did you ever recalculate that?
Jack: And I took 3 just now. 
Keith: Cause I remember it was wrong for both of us. 
Jack: I think we recalculated it on air, right?
Keith: Yeah. Ok. I know that I did. But I wasn’t sure if you…
Austin:; I think so. I think you’re both fine.
Keith: Ok.
Austin: Um, bards don’t get that much HP, unfortunately. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Or I guess low constitution score does not get… Yeah.
Jack: No, I’m just very skilled to make up for it. 
Austin: Great. Um, and so you’ve kind of like, toppled out into this um, overgrown greenhouse. The thing about this is like, you’re right. This is more greenhouse than aviary, except it has been a decade. And so, it’s become almost more like an open-air, you know, aviary-zoo type thing. Because plants have just grown everywhere here. It’s become, you know, damp and tropical in here because of the glass. Because it is the greenhouse, and you know, there are holes here and like, rain has been able to get in here and there. And like, it is… it is almost like you’re just in the jungle. 
But also, inside this building. Um, and uh, but that’s all like, among the rows and stacks and giant you know, shelves of small… of like, bags of seeds and stuff like that mixed in with just like, various bird like, cages that are now… most of which are empty. But the thing that is maybe most surprising is that when you look up from having been thrown down, there are 4 figures in front of you. Um, 4… 5… 5 orcs in front of you. And the one of them who is wearing a crown of bird beaks... 
Keith: Oh, this guy hates birds. 
Austin: ...says like, 
Austin (as unnamed orc leader): Look what we have here. Some gifts. Boys? 
Austin: And everyone draws their weapons and like, moves in around you. 
Keith: Now, I’m still in the sky. 
Austin: Yes.
Keith: I want to crash land. 
Austin: Hell yeah. 
Keith: Do you remember my dive bomb attack?
Austin: Yeah, I do. That’s a thing you do. 
Keith: I have a dive bomb attack, and then I also have a like… Here. Let’s do… let’s do that part first. 
Austin: Ok. 
Keith: Can I go first?
Austin: You can go first. 
Keith: Am I surprising them? Is that a thing that we do?
Austin: Yeah, I think so. This is… this is… I think you can do damage as established actually. I don’t think…. What was that? How do we do the dive bomb? What was the…. Did we write that down somewhere?
Keith: It is a… it is a dangerous attack. I count as a dangerous animal. 
Austin: Right. Ok. Which gives you extra damage, right?
Keith: Right. Gives me extra damage. 
Austin: So, yeah, just do that damage as… as um, established. So, that’s 4?
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Uh, alright. So, what’s this look like? Do you just like, quickly descend straight through the grou-… through the sky?
Keith: Yeah like, they like… they’re drawing their weapons and I’m just like, I just… basically shoot through the hole created by the glide bucket. 
Austin: Is there a… is there like a… like an eagle shriek style thing that the sprangaroo does or… does it make any sounds? Or is it silent? What’s it do?
Keith: Um, ok. So, honest first thought was that maybe it sounds like a hitmonchan. But… [laughs]
Austin: [sighs] Ok. Well… That’s…
Keith: But no. 
Austin: They own that sound.
Keith: Yeah? Alright. How did it… It… yeah. It just sound- I mean, it… I guess it doesn’t sound like a guy saying, ‘chan’, but…
Austin: Chan. No, it doesn’t. It does not. 
Keith: But it does sound… it does sound sort of like, um, an effort. Like… like if someone was paid to you know, go into a booth and record a bunch of sounds of jumping or punching. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Keith: It’s… I think it sounds like that, and not like a bird. Cause technically this thing is… doesn’t have a beak. It is a mammal. It looks sort of like a wallaby. 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. Ok. That makes sense. Uh, well, you land on Lumph. And Lumph is knocked the fuck out. He’s one of the three...
Keith: That’s what it sounds like. That’s what it goes. 
Austin: Lumph! 
Keith: Lumph! [foley] Lumph!
Austin: [laughing] Perfect. Uh, Lumph is knocked the fuck out. Uh, or dead. Is at 0 HP, as you do 4 damage to him. Um, which should give you a clue as to how few HP some of these orcs have. Um...
Keith: Can I… Is this intimidating to them?
Austin: Um, I think two of them...
Jack: Just a bird falling through the roof. 
Austin: I think… I think… the leader here…
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: ...goes, 
Austin (as unnamed orc leader): Another beak to add to my crown.
Keith: I turn back into a person. 
Keith (as Fero):I don’t have a beak! [Austin laughs] That thing you just saw didn’t have a beak!
Austin: Alright. What do you all… what do the rest of you do? As these two… so, it’s… So, it’s, at this point, it’s a total of 4 bandits or 4 orcs. Um, 4 orc bandits. It’s two of like, these like, henchmen. Two kind of like, lower ranking ones. The one with the… with the beak crown. And then one who has on like, a hood and has like, a staff and is… is already starting to do some like, incantations under his breath.
Jack: I want to draw my sword.
Austin: Uh huh.
Jack: And try and knock the staff out of the hand of the one who is doing…
Austin: Alright. Give me a-
Jack: ...spells. 
Austin: Give me a Hack and Slash.
Jack: Ok. Um… Yes. 
Austin: You just hit that button I think, unless there’s something else. No, I don’t think there’s anything else. 
Jack: Hey, ok. 
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: Look at that. That’s an 8. Nice work. Uh, deal your damage to the enemy…
Jack: Doesn’t usually happen. 
Austin: ...and the enemy makes an attack against you. So, it’s… it’s gonna exchange damage here. Uh, give me the… the damage roll. What’s your damage? You do…1d...
Jack: Um, my damage is 1d6.
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Can I just click damage? Oh, I can. 
Austin: You can. 
Jack: This is a great character sheet. 
Austin: It is. Uh, so you do two. 
Jack: Ok, well, you know. 
Austin: Um, well… ok. Well, see here’s the thing. Um, alright. So, that goes down two that… Um, you close in on the one with the staff, and you get like, a little bit of your sword… this is like, your machete, right? 
Jack: Uh, I think I’m using… my rapier? Cause I’m still carrying it. 
Austin: Oh did you keep that rapier? Yeah, do you still have the other rapier?
Jack: I think so. How do I find my inventory? It’s weird, isn’t it? It’s under… Where’s my inventory?
Austin: It’s under the ‘sub’ screen here. Boom. There we go. 
Jack: Oh, sure. 
Austin: Uh, book of gnoll etymology. Orc communication box. [overlapping] Hitchcock rapier. There you go.
Jack: [overlapping] Hitchcock rapier. Yeah. Sure do. 
Austin: Boom. So, yeah. That is… that is… um, no, wait. Do you have um...
Keith: Oh, I have no….
Austin: One second. Hold on. 
Keith: ….gear in my gear list. 
Austin: Oh, so here’s the thing. That is a precise weapon, which means… it wouldn’t have affected the last roll, but it does mean that you’re worse at it than using a regular sword. 
Jack: Oh, sure. Ok. 
Austin: But it’s piercing, which is nice. If you want to say you used it on this, you can say it. It just means that you would have done… So, Hitchcock’s rapier is close, precise, piercing, which means it uses dexterity and not strength cause it’s… 
Jack: Right. 
Austin: ...precise, but it’s piercing which means it ignores armor. Um, you also have this dueling knife, which is close and messy. Um, which is you know, messy and… messy stuff is intimidating. And messy is hard to hide. Um, and uh, yikes. Uh, and that uses strength which is better for you. Totally up to you. I’ll let you retroactively decided which one of those two things… It sounded like you were using a rapier on this one. 
Jack: Yeah, cause I kind of just want to knock the staff out of this person’s hand.
Austin: Yeah. So, you…
Jack: Um, and I… I know someone is gonna message me on Twitter and be like, why are you using a precision weapon for that. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Jack: And the answer is because I don’t necessarily want to cut this person in half. 
Austin: Right. So, you um, wait, hold on a sec. Let me just double check something. Oh, make sure you take this plus 1 armor forward. 
Jack: Oh, ok. 
Austin: So, in fact, this helps you literally immediately because you would have gotten… you would have gotten a two damage here. You… as you go in and like, try to get in on that staff, um, he like knocks the staff… or he knocks your rapier like, a little bit out of the way, and you catch him in the shoulder. And then from the top of the staff, he finishes saying some words, and this like, blast of purple energy like, flies out in a cone. But it only barely catches you. It catches you in the shoulder doing 1 damage. You both exchanged 1 point of damage here because of armor. You know what? Classic Lem.
Jack: And I have no armor now. 
Austin: Classic Lem King. 
Jack: It goes two ways, right? Either it’s your own friend murders you…
Austin: Yep. Or…
Jack: ...or [laughs] you do one point of damage. 
Austin: Alright, Hella Varal, what are you up to?
Ali: Um, is there like a clear leader identified here? Or like…
Austin: Totally. Yes. 
Ali: Biggest person in the group?
Austin: Yeah, the guy with the bird crown, for sure. 
Ali: Ok, are they still involved with Fero at this…?
Austin: No, he hasn’t. No, the… Fero… Fero like, disrupted the three like, henchmen. Killed one of them, and then… then the mage is interacting with Lem. So, the leader is definitely available for you to do whatever move you’re looking at right now. 
Ali: Ok. Perfect. Yeah. I… So, two things here. Similar to last time, she just like, very defiantly grabs the hilt of her sword, cause she is…
Austin: Yes. 
Ali: ….so ready to fucking go off here.
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: Um, but instead of doing the dark blade move, I would instead like to do Dead Eyes. 
Austin: Oooo. 
Ali: Which is, when you fix on someone with your cold, hard stare, roll + charisma. 
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: Which is basically just her looking across the field and being like, ‘I’m gonna fuck you up.’ [laughs]
Austin: Ok. 
Ali: And that’s an 11. 
Austin: That is an 11. Uh, so it means you get both effects. They flinch or hesitate and you learn something about their true nature. The GM will tell you what. Um, so I think… I’m gonna… I’m gonna expand on their true nature here. Um, because I’m a fan of the players. A fan of the characters. Which is you… catch his eyes and he… like, completely flinches. Like, he’s completely… uh, I think in fact, he like, go… he draws his sword, and then catches eyes with you and like, re-sheathes it. Just puts it right back in there. Um, and like, doesn’t even realize he’s… like, he does it is a martial motion. Do you know what I mean? 
It’s like, ‘Well, that’s right. And I’m gonna put my sword back away. That’s how I do it.’ [Ali laughs] Which I mean, does reveal something about him, right? Which is like, ‘Oh, he is a coward.’ Right? Like, he is… he is Prasha, the bird king or whatever, but like, he is a bit player in… in uh, a ruined Archive. And so, this isn’t… this guy ain’t shit. Two, he is… he’s hesitating. Flinching and hesitating which means like, if you want to do damage at this point, you can do damage at this point because he is left wide open. The third thing that… the third thing that is like, true nature is… [sighs] I think maybe it’s… it’s you know, I’m not gonna say this works this way all the time, but is there… Is there more text to that move? What is it? Let me see. When you fix someone with your cold, hard stare. I mean, the thing is like, if you’re learning something about their true nature… 
Um, I think, in this case, the thing that I want to give you on this is that you see through…. There’s a spell here. There’s a… there’s a familiar spirit here. Wait, maybe you didn’t know him though…. I don’t think you ever met this guy. Um, something is off about the mage. There is something… I don’t know if you catch his eyes, too, or if you see like, an aura, but there is an illusion spell happening on that mage. That mage…. Something is not up… something is not right with that mage. Which maybe tells you there’s like, another leader here, secretly. Like, this guy… this guy thinks he’s the leader, but really, he’s might… maybe he’s being played by the mage. You know?
Ali: Oh, so, I essentially learned who was really in control here. And I was like… yeah. Ok.
Austin: Yes. Yeah. I think that’s the way to think about it. Exactly. 
Ali: Ok. Um...
Austin: Um, do you also hit this dude? Now that he’s staggered and flinched. 
Ali: It’s tough because I specifically used this move to see if there was an opportunity to de-escalate. Um...
Austin: Do you want to say something? Cause you could also now say something to try to de-escalate. But this is not… this alone is making him flinch, which is opening an opportunity, but like...
[0:30:00]
Ali: No, no, no. Yeah, for sure. I’m deciding if I want to go the like, ‘Fuck off or you’re really gonna be dead’, and just like, scare them off or really just be like, ‘We’re not here for that.’ But I don’t think that I want to communicate with these people what we’re here for. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: Um, so I think that it’s more of a… I can maybe Dark Blade instead, I guess. I don’t want to talk about it like, moves, but I want it to be in sort of…. I do want them to be intimidated in such a way that Hella is able to like, do the thing that she wants to do without… drawing blood here. You know?
Austin: Yeah. So, I think there’s two things here. You could use Road to Perdition, which is the don the visage of… the thing that lets you don the visage of death, terrifying a target, blah, blah, blah. But you could also parlay here. Um, parlay is the one that’s like, ‘Hey, I’m making you an offer.’ And in this case, the thing you’re offer is their lives. That they get to keep them. [Ali laughs] Um, so I think… I think, go with that, maybe. 
Ali: Ok, yeah. 
Austin: But that means saying something, you know? Um, like basically, when you have leverage on a GM character and manipulate them, they ask you for something and do it if… You can ask them for something, and they’ll do it if you make a promise first. And on a 7 to 9, they’ll do the thing you want if you… if you give them concrete assurance. So, tell me what the threat is or the way you’re trying to de-escalate and then roll charisma. 
Ali: Um, yeah. I think it’s something like, very, like… it’s a growling sort of like, um… 
Ali (as Hella): Listen kid
Ali: [laughs] Like, very condescending sort of like, 
Ali (as Hella): If you do not get out of here, I will kill you. I speak with death herself regularly. 
Austin: Give me… give me a charisma. 
Ali: Sure.
Austin: Plus 1. 2d6+1. Alright, that’s an 8. Um, and so it is, they ask for something… Sorry. This is written in a weird way. I feel like I have to rewrite this. Um, but they will do it for you if you… if you can give them some concrete assurance of this. [Ali laughs] How do you give them a concrete assurance of your bond with death?
Ali: Can it be the… The last time we say Adelaide, you had um, like described her kingdom very specifically as like, a space where shadows are so extended. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: In a way that’s disorienting. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Um, and I wanted to mention that, in terms of like, using all of that death stuff, in terms of like, someone just looking at Hella and seeing the scope of their vision like change so dramatically. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: [laughs] Which is like, ‘Yeah, I fucking do that.’ Um, [laughs]
Austin: I think… to do that you may have to Road to Perdition here. 
Ali: Ok. She’s busy.
Austin: So, do that. It’s another charisma roll. That is another 8, which is fine because the thing here is like, either spend 1 peace or was that what we ended up calling them? Peace?
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Which you should have gotten one. You should have gotten some of that. 
Ali: Ok cool.
Austin: Because you did the thing. Right? 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: You got peace from doing the task. 
Ali: So, I can have two?
Austin: Um, when you fulfill death’s task, hold 3 torment, er… peace, in this case. So, peace.
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: So, yeah, you can spend one of those peace to… to do this. So yeah. Yeah. You’re… the shadows go long. You don the visage of death. Um, and I think the…. Prasha who is the lead orc here goes like, 
Austin (as Prasha): Yeah, of course. Send death my regards. I know her well, also. Everyone, let’s go for a walk. 
Jack: This dude’s great. I love this dude. [Keith laughs]
Austin: Um, and the ma-
Jack: This- [laughs]
Austin: The mage is like, 
Austin (as the Mage): We can’t just give up this place.
Austin: And you know that voice immediately, Lem King. You, too, Fero. That is the voice of an old halfling you knew. Isaac Adelton. 
Keith: Wait, the… 
Austin: The Illusion mage. 
Keith: The illus- yeah. Uh huh. 
Jack: Ugh…
Austin: Who last you knew… the last time you knew about him…
Keith: I thought he…
Austin: He had… uh huh. 
Keith: I thought he died. 
Austin: He didn’t die. He…
Jack: He got b-
Austin: Yeah. [Ali gasps]
Jack: He got bubbled?
Austin: He got bubbled. 
Keith: He got bubbled.
Austin: But he’s not there anymore. He’s not in the bubble anymore. 
Jack: Oh, shit. 
Keith (as Fero): [shouting] Hey!
Jack: I think… I think Lem just stands up and goes, 
Jack (as Lem): [shouting] Isaac!
Keith (as Fero): [shouting] Isaac! [Ali laughs] What are you doing here? [Austin and Jack laugh]
Austin (as Isaac): Ah… Yeah, we gotta take that walk guys. Uh…
Keith: I...
Austin: And the orcs all start to leave and Isaac is like-- 
Keith: I tackle Isaac. 
Austin: Ok. Um… give me a… give me Defy Danger strength. 
Jack: [laughing] God. We came here just planning to kidnap a bird, but then we kidnap [laughs] a mage, as well. 
Austin: The other orcs are just like, getting the fuck out of here at this point.
Keith: Defy Danger?
Austin: Give me… strength, yeah. 
Keith: Uh, strength. 
Jack: Can I assist on this?
Austin: Uh, yeah. Totally. If you need to. 
Keith: Let’s both tackle Isaac, yeah. [overlapping] That’s an 11. 
Jack: [overlapped] What do I? How do I do…?
Austin: Oh, you’re good. 
Keith: Yeah, you’re good. 
Jack: Oh, I don’t need to. Yeah, no. We’re good.
Austin: Um, I mean, you can still both do it in the fiction, if you’d like to…
Keith: Yeah. Yep. 
Austin: ...or whatever, but like… And as soon as you tackle him to the ground, he sli- you know, the orcish form around him slips away, and he is uh, Isaac Adelton, yet again. He grew a soul patch, but that is it. That’s the only change. 
Keith (as Fero): You look stupid. What are you doing here?
Austin (as Isaac): Hey, get off of me. 
Keith (as Fero): What are you doin- Where? How did you?
Austin (as Isaac): Get-! Hey! 
Keith (as Fero): Hey! 
Austin (as Isaac): You’re that...
Keith (as Fero): You tryin’ to get that bird guy to attack me. What are you doing?
Austin (as Isaac): We got a… we got a whole nice situation here. I don’t know what you need, but you shouldn’t have crashed your big ship in here.
Keith (as Fero): That was not me that did that. 
Jack (as Lem): Fero, can we be a little quieter. I’m worried about scaring the bird away. 
Keith (as Fero): [whispering] That was not… That was not me that did that. 
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah, but it was you… him.
Keith (as Fero): It…
Jack (as Lem): [whispered] It wasn’t me. It was Hella.
Austin: Hella, they’re talking to this....One, that orc turned into a halfling. Two, they are talking to him like they know him. 
Ali: Yeah. I… Two things. At the adorable runaway, at that person with the crown, I want the fucking yakuza side quest jingle to just go off is all. [Austin and Jack laugh] After the person, and just like, that person needs help on being a cool person. 
Austin: Definitely. 
Ali: And then, I think that she just like, kind of… She’s like, confused and wants to know what’s going on, but in the middle of the conversation, I think that she’s just kind of like, still hand on sword…
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: ...keeping her eye on the horizon and letting this conversation happen. 
Austin: Ok.
Jack (as Lem): Isaac.
Austin: Isaac’s like, 
Austin (as Isaac): [whispering] Let me stand up. 
Keith (as Fero): [whispering] You are a shit. You cannot stand up.
Jack (as Lem): Let him stand up. We’re gonna k-... Isaac.
[crosstalking throughout]
Austin (as Isaac): You said you’re gonna kill me!
Jack (as Lem): Don’t try anything. 
Austin (as Isaac): He said he was gonna kill me. 
Keith (as Fero): Who said that?
Jack (as Lem): I didn’t say I was gonna kill you. 
Austin (as Isaac): That guy, Lem! Lem said I’m gonna k- and he was gonna say...
Keith (as Fero): If you don’t shut up, I’m gonna kill you. 
Austin (as Isaac): Ahhh.
Jack (as Lem): I didn’t say- No. Ok. Let go of him, Fero.
Keith (as Fero): Ok.
Jack (as Lem): Isaac, if you run away-
Austin (as Isaac): Which one’s bad cop? I can’t tell. 
Jack (as Lem): This is-
Keith (as Fero): We’re both…
Jack: And I point… I point at Hella. [Ali laughs]
Austin (as Isaac): Oh, she’s the worst.
Keith (as Fero): We are not… neither of us are bad cops. [Austin and Keith laugh] But we will hurt you.
Jack (as Lem): How did you get out?
Austin (as Isaac): What do you mea- how did I get out? I got out. What do you-? Get out. What, get out…
Keith (as Fero): The bubble. 
Austin (as Isaac): Get out of what?
Keith (as Fero): You were in the bubble. 
Jack (as Lem): You were in the bubble. 
Keith (as Fero): In the bubble. Arrell bubbled you. 
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah, it was… Yeah, but it was like, really-
Jack (as Lem): Where is he?
Austin (as Isaac): You know, there weren’t many people in there
Keith (as Fero): Is wasn’t really what?
Austin (as Isaac): ...but me. I wasn’t havin’ a good time. So, I got out. 
Keith (as Fero): How did you get out?
Jack (as Lem): How?
Austin (as Isaac): You just figure… I fig- you know, I just got a door.
Keith (as Fero): What-
Jack (as Lem): How long were you in there?
Keith (as Fero): Write it down. Write down the instructions.
Austin (as Isaac): Ok. It was a while ago. What are you talking about? It wasn’t that… I haven’t been in there in years. Remember how to get out?… I haven’t been in there. 
Jack (as Lem): [sighs] Isaac, how long were you in the bubble for?
Austin (as Isaac): Well like, for real for real? Or like, for inside the time?
Keith (as Fero): Both. Answer it both ways. 
Austin (as Isaac): It was a long time inside. And I got real bored, and I got real anxious. 
Jack (as Lem): Sure, Ok. Everyone-
Austin (as Isaac): But I was like, ‘well, what happened outside? Did the Heat and the Dark come? Or is it- what’s happening?’ And then also the thing is, I’m very clever.
[overlapping]
Jack (as Lem): Sure.
Keith (as Fero): Shut up. 
Austin (as Isaac): Well, I am. And I didn’t like it cause everybody else in there was real clever, too, cause they were like me. 
Jack (as Lem): Oh, no longer the smartest person in the room, huh, Isaac?
Keith (as Fero): Oooohhh.
Austin (as Isaac): But I was.
Keith (as Fero): Small fish, big pond.
Austin (as Isaac): But it was a bi- It was me. I was the one in the pond. I didn’t like it that much. So, I got out of there, and then I came… Then, you know, the whole thing with the- the whole Archives flooded, I guess. 
Jack (as Lem): How did you get out, Isaac?
Austin (as Isaac): I took a door. I took- I opened a door. I found a door, and it lead me right back. 
Keith (as Fero): How did you- What do you mean you found a door?
Austin (as Isaac): You know, I do the magic. I do the- I go [foley] ‘Boohm.’ And then...
Keith (as Fero): You did magic and ‘boohm’, and now you’re out? 
Jack (as Lem): Who helped you?
Keith (as Fero): Who helped you?
Austin (as Isaac): No one. No one helped me. 
Keith (as Fero): Who helped you?
Austin (as Isaac): Certainly not Arrell. He and I, we’re not on speaking terms anymore. 
Jack (as Lem): Hmm, no. Us neither. 
Austin (as Isaac): Well then, it seems like we’re all friends. Enemy of my enemy.
Keith (as Fero): No, it does not. You were just-
Jack (as Lem): I don’t think that’s true, Isaac.
Keith (as Fero): Did you not recognize us? When I was a-
Jack (as Lem): Ok, sorry. Quick sidebar here. Hella, this is Isaac Adelton. 
Austin (as Isaac): You were a big bird!
Keith (as Fero): And then I was a person. I transformed, and I said- Remember I shouted? I said, ‘I didn’t have a beak!’
Jack (as Lem): Shh! Fero, shh.
Keith (as Fero): [whispered] Ok. I said, I didn’t have a beak. And I was-
Austin (as Isaac): What is- Whatever.
Keith (as Fero): Whatever whatever!
Austin (as Isaac): ...if it’s a bird. Next to a bird. Whatever is next to a bird.
Keith (as Fero): But I’m just saying, you saw me turn back into a guy!
Ali (as Hella:) Fero, stop having this conversation. He attacked Lem. Your point is made. 
Keith (as Fero): Ok. Good point. He’s just a shit.
Ali (as Hella): Who is this guy? 
Keith (as Fero):  He gets under my skin. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah.
Austin (as Isaac): You were coming on our territory. This is our homebase.
Jack (as Lem): He’s a halfling-
Keith: I hit him in the face.
Jack (as Lem): Shh, shh, shh...
Austin (as Isaac): This is our homebase.
Keith: I hit him.
Austin (as Isaac): Ah.
Jack (as Lem): No, don’t-
Ali (as Hella): Woah, woah, woah, woah. Let’s break this up. 
Jack: And like pulls- pulls Fero away.
[major crosstalking]
Austin (as Isaac): He hit me!
Keith (as Fero):  I hit him. 
Jack (as Lem): Yeah, I know. 
Keith (as Fero):  It’s… you were literally asking for it. 
Austin (as Isaac): I wasn’t… I didn’t say, please hit me.
Jack (as Lem): Ok, Hella this is-
Keith (as Fero): This stupid, annoying voice asked for it. 
Jack (as Lem): Don’t hit him again, Fero.
Austin (as Isaac): Sometime- I was born with this voice.
Ali (as Hella): Let’s-
Jack (as Lem): Hella, this is Isaac Adelton. He is a… he is an illusion-
Austin (as Isaac): A pleasure to meet you, Hella. 
Ali (as Hella): Oh. 
Austin (as Isaac): You have a nice sword.
Ali (as Hella): Yo, did I try to go see you in a jail once? You were the guy-
Austin (as Isaac): How would I know that?
Jack (as Lem): Yeah, this is the guy.
Keith (as Fero): That’s the guy. He was in jail once. 
Jack (as Lem): Hella, this is the guy. 
Austin (as Isaac): Never been a jail that could hold me. 
Ali (as Hella): Oh, shut up.
Keith (as Fero): How many different
Jack (as Lem): Yeah, that’s what we found.
Keith (as Fero): How many different jails have you been in?
Austin (as Isaac): [pauses] One. And it didn’t hold me.
Keith (as Fero): That’s not true. 
Austin (as Isaac): Never one. 
Keith (as Fero): Because you were also in the bubble. So-
Austin (as Isaac): That’s not a jail. 
Jack (as Lem): Alright. 
Keith (as Fero): Did it… was it not?
Jack (as Lem): Isaac, we need to… [sighs] Hella-
Ali (as Hella): Can we confer?
Jack (as Lem): Fero, can we confer? Yeah, ok. 
Austin (as Isaac): You want me to-?
Jack (as Lem): Look. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah! Sit there.
Jack (as Lem): Just go over there. Yeah. Sit down. 
Keith: I’m holding him. 
Jack (as Lem): Down. Ok.
Keith (as Fero): Wait. Do I… do I need to confer, too?
Ali (as Hella): I would love to confer.
Jack (as Lem): Yeah. All of us. 
Keith (as Fero): Ok. Hi. Ok. Watch him though. 
Ali: I… Hella does the two eyes to the… 
[crosstalk]
Austin: Uh huh. He looks at his staff on the ground, like...
Keith: Can you do… can you do a throat slit, too? Like motion?
Ali: Can we just pick up his staff?
Jack: I’m gonna go pick up his staff.
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin (as Isaac): Ah, damnit. 
Ali: I do do the throat, as well though. 
Keith: Ok, cool.
Austin: He sits on like a broken part of the skyship. 
Jack (as Lem): Ok. Ok. What are we doing with this piece of shit?
Ali (as Hella): Yeah, can I get up to speed?
Jack (as Lem): Ok, this is Isaac Adelton. He’s a… he’s a… an illusion mage. He’s a halfling. He’s pretty good at one thing, which is looking like other things. 
Keith (as Fero): Magical lying. He’s a magical liar.
Jack (as Lem): And making things look… he’s a magical liar. And he’s… pretty good at it. But he’s also-
Austin (as Isaac): I do very good. That’s correct.
Jack (as Lem): Shut up. You’re not involved in this con- [laughs] in this...
Keith (as Fero): Huddle.
Jack (as Lem): ...conference. Ok. Hella. The reason he’s interesting is that he was one of the people. He made a deal with the wizard Arrell. He got bubbled to save him from the Heat and the Dark. But… but he found his way out. And I think this is… this is why he’s interesting to me right now. Is ‘A’, he found his way out, and he won’t tell us how. I don’t buy it. 
Ali (as Hella): Hmm.
Jack (as Lem): There’s something else going on there. ‘B’, uh…. did he really just get bored? Who would go back to the Heat and the Dark after just getting bored? So, I guess my question is, are we kidnapping this guy?
Keith (as Fero): Yes. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. W- Hmm. We’re definitely kidnapping. I just want to, in his defense, say we were so bored. Um [laughs] and-
Jack (as Lem): Well, but… Yeah. 
Keith (as Fero): In the sword, you mean?
Jack (as Lem): Yeah. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. It wasn’t great. 
Keith (as Fero): It was a paradise sword. 
Jack (as Lem): It’s beautiful. It’s beautiful. It’s-
Keith (as Fero): It’s so annoying that you all keep saying how bored you were in there. 
Jack (as Lem): Can we not talk about this in front of Isaac?
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. Sure.
Ali (as Hella): I’m sorry, Fero. Um… Yeah, I mean, leveraging this to-
Ali: Uh, she’s so much quieter now.
Ali (as Hella): Leveraging this dude’s like… even if he has information on Arrell, that’s like, gold to us at this point. 
Jack (as Lem): Yeah. Yeah. And some way of understanding how the bubbles work. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah.
Keith (as Fero): I have an idea.
Ali (as Hella): Ok. 
Keith (as Fero): [shouting] Alright!
Ali (as Hella): Don’t do it. Tell me what it is.
Keith (as Fero): [whispered] Oh, I’m gonna pretend like we’re- that we decided to kill him, and when he-
Jack (as Lem): No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Keith (as Fero): -snivels and begs for his life-
Jack (as Lem): No, no, no, no, no. This is cruel.
Keith (as Fero): -we’ll say, ‘Ok, I guess we’ll just take you with us.’
Jack (as Lem): No, this is cruel. And then, Isaac-
Austin (as Isaac): Can you guys talk a little louder? I can’t hear you.
[crosstalking]
Jack (as Lem): Isaac.
Keith (as Fero): [talking loudly] Alright. I guess we’ll kill him!
Ali (as Hella): [nervously] W-w-w-w-w-w-w-w
Keith (as Fero): Yeah!
Jack (as Lem): No. Hang on.
Austin (as Isaac): Wahh!
Keith (as Fero): That sounds right to me!
Ali (as Hella): [nervously] No, no, no, no, no.
Jack (as Lem): No, we’re not gonna kill you. No, we’re not gonna kill you. No, no, no.
Keith (as Fero): Why are you doing that? What’s the problem?
Ali (as Hella): Fero, I-
Keith (as Fero): He’ll… he’ll agree to come with us if he thinks it- it’ll save his life.
Ali (as Hella): I want to be-
Jack (as Lem): He’s gonna come with us… [laughs]
Ali (as Hella): Lem, go on.
Jack (as Lem): He’s gonna come with us whether he likes it or not. Isaac, we’re kidnapping you.
Austin (as Isaac): I… don’t think that’s true.
Jack (as Lem): Turn around. We want to tie your arms.
Austin (as Isaac): No. I- I cou- No.
[crosstalking]
Ali (as Hella): Wha-?
Keith (as Fero): See, this is what I mean. He’s very tricky.
Ali (as Hella): What I-
Jack (as Lem): Turn-
Austin (as Isaac): I have a life here.
Keith (as Fero): Like, what kind of life?
Austin (as Isaac): Me and Prasha-
Keith (as Fero): Pretending to be an orc?
Austin (as Isaac): [sighs] One, I… You know, it’s- there’s a lot of orcs around here, and if you’re a halfling illusionist mage, that’s like, putting a target on your back. I take a bull-
Austin: He doesn’t know the word ‘bullet-proof vest’
Austin (as Isaac): That’s like plate armor for me [laughs]
Keith: Arrow proof vest.
Austin (as Isaac): Two… Two, yeah. I have a life. Me and Prasha, we’re the Bird Boys. And-
Ali (as Hella): [laughs]
Keith (as Fero): Why? [laughing]
Ali: This is in character laughing.
Keith (as Fero): Why?
Austin (as Isaac): Why are you laughing at me?
Keith (as Fero): Why did you convince that… that- [Jack laughs] Why did you convince that orc that birds… matter? 
Austin (as Isaac): Birds matter a great deal. They pollinate plants. They chirp in the morning. 
Jack (as Lem): Oh Jesus Christ. They pollinate plants?
Austin (as Isaac): They’re like a natural… alarm.
Keith (as Fero): They do something else. Pollinate plants.
Ali (as Hella): Can we confer?
Jack (as Lem): Yeah. Ok. Alright.
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. We’re conferring. Shut up. 
Ali (as Hella): We cannot tell this fucking guy about the bird we’re here for. 
Jack (as Lem): No. No way. No way. I’m just gonna go find it.
Keith (as Fero): By the way, do you-
Jack (as Lem): I’m gonna go up over there.
Keith (as Fero): Do you know that bird’s name?
Austin (as Isaac): What were you guys coming to the aviary for anyway?
Keith (as Fero): We crash landed. 
Jack (as Lem): I left something here. 
Keith (as Fero): You saw us crash land. It was obviously an accident. 
Jack (as Lem): Yeah, no. We crash landed. [laughs]
Austin (as Isaac): What a coincidence I’d be here, honestly. That seems like a low chance situation.
Keith (as Fero): It’s an incredibly low chance.
Austin (as Isaac): You could of landed anywhere.
Keith (as Fero): It’s-
Austin (as Isaac): You could have landed in the Bear zone.
Jack (as Lem): [sighs] I dropped my watch. I have to go look for my watch now. 
Keith (as Fero): What do you- Hold on I-
Jack: Uh, and Lem just leaves.
Keith (as Fero): Sorry, we need to do a huddle. We have to huddle. One more huddle. 
Jack: Oh sorry. 
Keith (as Fero): One more huddle, please. Do you know the name of the bird, cause I could just like, call its name. 
Ali (as Hella): Wa-wa-wait. 
Jack (as Lem): [replying to Fero] No. 
[0:45:00]
Ali (as Hella): You guys go find. And I’m gonna do a little… a good cop. 
Ali: And she winks. [Austin laughs]
Jack (as Lem): You know, out of the three of us, Hella? 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. Uh huh. 
Jack (as Lem): Yeah. Good. Yeah. Go for it. 
Austin: Ok. So you two go-
Keith (as Fero): Don’t be too gentle.
Austin: My god. [laughs] Lem and Fero, you go exploring the stacks, I’m guessing. And looking for this bird. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: And the jungle. 
Jack: Yeah, the birds stacks. 
Austin: The bird stacks. 
Keith (as Fero): [shouting] Watch! 
[Everyone laughs hard]
Jack: Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ.
Austin: Oh my god. People say we don’t have a funny show. They can fuck off.
Keith: I know. Isn’t that crazy?
Austin: It’s unbelievable. Um, god damn. [aughs] What’s the name of the bird? What do you- What is the bird? You would know it, Lem. 
Keith: Wha- What is the name of the bird?
Austin: Cause you succeeded.
Jack: Uh, the bird is call- [sighs] Let me open up my names document real quick. 
Austin: Uh huh. While you do this, let’s do this interrogation. I’m gonna take a sip of water. 
Ali: [laughs] Ok. I think-
Austin (as Isaac): Ah. So, where’d the other two go? What? Ahh, it’s just you and me now, Miss Hella. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. I- Haha, now that these guys are out of here, uh, what’s up?
Austin (as Isaac): Do you-
Keith: Wow. Good cop. 
Ali: [laughs] I’m being a cop. [Jack laughs]
Austin (as Isaac): I don’t know. I’m just- you know, you gave me a kind of a bad day. 
Ali (as Hella): Yea- I… we have to wait anyway. 
Ali: I think she like, sits down on like a [laughing] different part of the
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: ...boat, next to this dude. And is like, 
Ali (as Hella): So, what’s up with this bird gang? You were talking about that. That’s important to you. 
Austin (as Isaac): The Bird Boys, yeah. That’s us.
Ali (as Hella): What’s up with that?
Austin (as Isaac): Well, cause like, everybody needs a thing, right? Like when I first got here, people didn’t have like… What’s the word I’m looking for? Like, good gimmicks, you know? [Keith laughs hard] It was like a… the you know, Building B Boys. Who the fuck cares about building B? I don’t know- What’s in building b anyway?
Ali (as Hella): Well, bees practice-
Austin (as Isaac): Bureaus?
Ali (as Hella): They like travel....
Austin (as Isaac): Bowling Balls?
Ali (as Hella): ...across nations, and like, pollinate plants. And people-
Austin (as Isaac): That’s what I’m saying! And so people understand that the Bird Boys are here to play for real. The Bird Boys aren’t here to play is what I mean to say, actually. We’re not here to play for real. We’re here to play for real. And-
Ali (as Hella): Wait, can you go back? Are you playing or not playing?
Austin (as Isaac): We’re not playin’ at all. We gotta play for real. [Keith laughs hard. Ali laughs] And so, you know, it started with us. We had the bird mask. We had the bird, you know… we had the bird crown. We had the whole bird wing situation. We got rid of the wings. It was like a little too much, but then…
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. 
Austin (as Isaac): ...bit by bit other people, they start coming up with their own thing. And it just kind of makes everything a little easier. Cause then you go and instead of being like, ‘Oh, did we have an alliance with the boys from B block or… did we have a treaty with the… the people who you know, take care of the… in the gardening section? No, I don’t know about the gardening…  Whatever Who cares about that?’But when like, the Floral Femmes come to town, like yeah. That’s… that’s energy. I know… me and the Floral Femmes, we go back. Bird boys, Floral Femmes. That’s the… that’s the true alliance. 
Keith: Well, there’s cross-pollination. I’m not here. Bye. Sorry.
Austin: [In Isaac’s voice] There’s… You’re not here, but there is...
Austin (as Isaac): There is cross-pollination.
Austin: [In Isaac’s voice] It’s as if a voice told me.
Austin (as Isaac): Uh, you know, and so bit by bit they- you know, people get masks. People get outfits. It’s- We’re doin’ ok, you know? You know I didn’t think enough. I shouldn’t have- I shouldn’t have judged you. You judge a book wrong. Don’t judge a book by the back cover. [Keith and Ali laugh] And so, I should have realized, you have a sense of drama. You have a sense of… you know, you did the thing. The-
Ali (as Hella): You hear that death thing? All I have is drama.
Austin (as Isaac): That’s all drama. I think you could be… you could be… you could be like, the next queen of a gang around here. You know, you’re name’s Hella. What’s? What rhymes with Hella? [pauses and sighs] Nothing. [Ali and Keith laugh] Hella Va- No, that’s already your name.
Ali (as Hella): Fella? That doesn’t work. Um…
Austin (as Isaac): We get an ‘H’ name. ‘H’ names. Uh, ‘Say Hello’ No, that’s not really. ‘Hello to Hella’
Ali (as Hella): I used to go by ‘The Queen Killer’. That was-
Austin (as Isaac): The Queen Killer?
Ali (as Hella): That was such a good one. [laughs]
Austin (as Isaac): You killed a qu- Oh, you killed a queen. Who’d you kill? Wait a second! You’re the Hella… The Queen Killa?
Ali (as Hella): That’s me.
Austin (as Isaac): You’re Ordennan. 
Ali (as Hella): Uh huh. 
Austin (as Isaac): You’re dead.
Ali (as Hella): Wha- Excuse me?
Austin (as Isaac): Aren’t you dead? 
Ali (as Hella): Currently? No.
Austin (as Isaac): Oh. I- They had said the Queen Killer died… a whole... a whole thing.
Ali (as Hella): They’re saying that?
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah, they said the Queen Killer, she died. 
Ali (as Hella): I was kind of away for a little bit. I was dead in a sense.
Austin (as Isaac): Ok. They said… What I had heard… what I had heard was that the Queen Killer died trying to protect um… uh, phew... What was her name? The… the other one? The Justiciar. The chief justiciar? Quint- Quinta something. 
Ali (as Hella): I- They’re sayin’ that?
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah, they said that the… there was a… a whole thing. That were killed by, I don’t know, some magic people or whatever. Um, and so gotta get justice. 
Ali (as Hella): Which magic people no-?
Austin (as Isaac): I don’t know. 
Ali (as Hella): Which magic people?
Austin (as Isaac): I don’t follow Ordennan whatever.
Ali (as Hella): Who does?
Austin (as Isaac): Who does? Was that- like, rhetorical?
Ali (as Hella): You saw all these gangs around. Someone knows the full story. 
Austin (as Isaac): No, we’re all busy up here. This is all Archives, pickin’ through trash. [Keith laughs]
Ali (as Hella): That- ugh.That’s gonna be a fun mistake to clear up. Uh, huh. Um, anyway, 
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah, anyway. Um…
Ali (as Hella): So, this is what you do now? What happened with the… You don’t run with Arrell, you just run with other people now?
Austin (as Isaac): Arrell was real upset at me when I came back. 
Ali (as Hella): Oh yeah?
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah, if he didn’t want to… I told him if we could do like a… like a nights and weekends type thing with the bubble, I’d be more comfortable with that. But he was like, ‘No. That’s not the point. You don’t know when the Heat and the Dark is gonna come. You gotta be in the bubble all the time.’ And I said, ‘Ahh, That’s a little too much for me. I’ll take my chances. Like, I’ll probably be dead from old age before it gets here.’ Look, it’s here now. It’s not that big of a deal. We live up here. It’s safe.
Ali (as Hella): Yeah, I mean… you’re better off out here. Well… 
Austin (as Isaac): That’s what I’m sayin’. I was in there. It was just- It was not, um… It wasn’t… Like, I could tell it was all fake. Maybe because I knew it was all fake. But I could tell it was all fake and like, [sighs] Hella, I feel like I can really open up to you, you know? I think you just have that personality. I think-
Ali (as Hella): Oh, I appreciate you saying that.
Austin (as Isaac): It’s just like, if you’re gonna be… I like to finesse things in life, you know what I mean?
Ali (as Hella): Uh huh. 
Austin (as Isaac): And I like to like, find solutions. But in there, there weren’t no problems. Except ones I came up with. But I can’t come up with a problem that I can’t solve. And there isn’t a problem I can’t solve. I’m a problem solver. But I like feeling like I can come up with a solution, not that I already know the solution. Do you know what I mean?
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. 
Austin (as Isaac): You need other people. You need other people to push you. To make you better. That’s why I like the gangs and the gimmicks and the you know, rivalries. Cause it keeps you on your toes.
Ali (as Hella): Yeah, but the- the way that you want to spend your time is running around in a bird mask pretending to be an orc?
Austin (as Isaac): I’m not pretending to be an orc. It’s camouflage. 
Ali (as Hella): Oh, just for us? You don’t do that all the time. 
Austin (as Isaac): Well, it’s camouflage for the rest of the Bird Boys, too. They don’t want to hang out with a halfling. They think-
Ali (as Hella): I’m gonna tell you two things. 
Austin (as Isaac): Ok. 
Ali (as Hella): If you can’t tell those people you’re a halfling, they’re not your friends. 
Austin (as Isaac): [sighs]
Ali (as Hella): The second thing. Uh, they’re gonna fucking kill me, but you like figuring things out.
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah. 
Ali (as Hella): And we’re in the end of the world anyway. 
Austin (as Isaac): Who could say? Maybe. 
Ali (as Hella): [sighs] We’re trying to make this thing. 
Austin (as Isaac): Like a-
Ali (as Hella): Over at the Last University.
Austin (as Isaac): Like a- What like a model? Like a… What are you trying to do? Are you trying to make like a cake? What are you tryin’ to make? You tryin’ to make-
Ali (as Hella): No. But-
Austin (as Isaac): ...like… like a boat?
Ali (as Hella): Do you know someone who can like, make a small statue? 
Ali: And she like gestures like a foot high.
Austin (as Isaac): Like a small statue of what?
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. 
Austin (as Isaac): Like a statue of a cake? [Keith laughs]
Ali (as Hella): No. Of like, a lady.
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah, I can make a sta- I mean, yeah, I know someone. Their rates are very high. 
Austin: He crosses his arms. 
Ali (as Hella): Just relax. This is just a birthday present sort of situation. Um…
Austin (as Isaac): Who you makin’ a statue for?
Ali (as Hella): I have this friend who had one of herself somewhere else, and I just thought that she- it would be funny. Anyway, don’t worry about it. Um… I-
Austin (as Isaac): But we could make a statue. I could do- You get me some bricks. I could just [snaps] Boom. It looks like a statue now. 
Ali (as Hella): Word? Yeah?
Austin (as Isaac): That’s how my magic works. 
Austin: He’s like rubbing his hands together. 
Austin (as Isaac): In fact, if you bring me my staff, I could do it right now.
Austin: I think Lem still has the staff, so I don’t think that’s-
Ali: Ok, There’s like-
Austin: In fact, we should cut to the staff. Lem, you have the staff. It has a bird skull on top of it. 
Jack: Sure. 
Austin: Uh, what’s the name of this bird you’re looking for?
Jack (as Lem): They are called Cartwright’s Wrens. 
Austin: Ok. 
Keith (as Fero): Is that the name of the species or the name of the bird?
Jack (as Lem): That is the name of the species. I do not know the name of the bird. [Ali and Jack laugh]
Keith (as Fero): You don’t know the bird’s name?
Jack (as Lem): We had tens of thousands of- Fero, we had tens of thousands of birds here. 
Keith (as Fero): Ok. 
Jack (as Lem): And I didn’t even work in birds. The bird people were arseholes. 
Keith (as Fero): Was… Were those people ba- Was that guy with the crown- was he one of the- bird people?
Jack (as Lem): I don’t know. Like, a huge amount of people worked here, Fero. 
Keith (as Fero): Like, 20? 25?
Jack (as Lem): Yeah, like 20 or 25. We’re looking for like, a bird like the size of… like the size of my fist. 
Keith (as Fero): I know wrens. 
Jack (as Lem): Um..
Keith (as Fero): I know… yeah. I know wrens. 
Jack (as Lem): Yeah, yeah. 
Keith (as Fero): I’m.. hm. I want to… find this bird. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Keith: I’m gonna get… a… bird’s eye view...
Austin: Uh huh. 
Keith: ...of the aviary. 
Jack: A bird’s eye view of the bird.
Austin: Uh huh. 
Keith: I want to climb up to the top… branches, I guess, cause you said like, this thing’s like
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: ...trying to bust out like this-
Austin: Oh, yeah.
Keith: Ok. I’m gonna-
Austin: I think probably already has in places, you know?
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Um, yeah, give me a Discern Realities. Oh, had you already done a Defy Danger? Or is that- that was to tackle the guy. That was that.
Keith: That was to tackle the guy, yeah. 
Austin: Alright, so Discern Realities. Uh, you got a 9. Uh, alright. You get one question, unless Lem helps you. Lem could help you on this and get you up to a 10. 
Keith: Yeah, we’re both looking. 
Jack: Yeah, I’ll help. 
Keith: That makes sense. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Keith (as Fero): Do you want to climb up here?
Jack (as Lem): Uh, yeah, sure.
Austin: Give me… give me an aid… Aid, Interfere. An Aid roll here.
Jack: Uh, here we go. 
Austin: That works. +1. That’s a 9. Uh...
Keith: Alright, awesome. 
Austin: Boom. So, yeah. Between the two of you, you can ask me three questions. 
Keith: And we still get one… plus one forward?
Austin: Plus one forward, yep. 
Keith: Alright. 
Austin: Or you, Fero, you will get +1 forward on acting with-
Keith: Right. 
Austin: Acting on it. 
Keith: Ok. Do we want to do-  Do we want to go- one… Let’s just decide. Yeah, let’s decide together. We’ll chum it out. 
Jack: Um, I mean, what here is useful or valuable to me?
Keith: That’s a good one. What is-?
Jack: Uh, feels- Oh, should we do them one at a time? Yeah. 
Keith: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Jack: Let’s do them one at a time. 
Austin: Um, what’s the bird look like?
Jack: It’s like a small, brown bird, you know?
Austin: Uh huh. Um…
Keith: Indistinct? Just like a… like a wren? Wrens are cute. 
Jack: Yeah.
Keith: Wrens are particularly round birds.
Jack: Yeah. 
Keith: They’re very squishy round. 
Jack: Timid. 
Austin: So then, yeah. I think there is like, a… one of these birds… one of these Cartwright’s Wrens inside of um, a little… There is like a, a pool of water that has um, kind of pooled together. As like a… kind of an… a pond. Um, that is… It’s not a natural pond in the sense that there wasn’t just a pond here. But some of the growth has sort of grown in such a way that um, like some of the plants have grown in such a way that there’s like, almost like a collection of vines and tree branches that have created like, a tight almost tumor-like collection of like, wood flesh that has a depression in it. That’s almost made a bird bath. And there in the middle of it is one of these birds.
Keith: Le- Just to be safe, let’s use these last two questions before doing anything crazy. 
Austin: Sure. 
Jack: Absolutely. 
Keith: What here is not what it appears to be?
Austin: Um, that bird bath is actually a plant that eats meat. 
Keith: Is that true?
Austin: Yes. 
Keith: I fuckin’ knew it. I swear to god. I knew that it was gonna be one of these damn plants. 
Austin: If you are not very careful, it will, like a bear trap, close around the bird. 
Keith: I’m s-
Jack: Ok. So, hm-
Keith: I’m saying this to- to Lem. Cause I- Does Lem- Does Discern Realities, when there’s an aid, does it mean that we both-
Austin: It doesn’t. 
Keith: ...are seeing this?
Austin: Only you are seeing this, Fero. But like, but you know, it… it’s… it’s fine for both of you to have put this together in different ways, you know?
Keith: Ok. Got it. Um…
Jack: Ok.
Keith: So, we did-
Austin: That’s two. 
Keith: We did valuable, right? Ok. So...
Austin: Uh huh.
Jack: Uh huh. 
Keith: ...what should I be on the lookout for?
Austin: You’re up- you’re up high up, right?
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Um, uh… You hear the sound of drumming from outside. And it’s like got a really sharp, high-pitched bad like, badly… not tuned, but loose snare drum. And the like, skin of the drum does not feel like it’s particularly taut or like it’s made out of a cheap material. And then, you kind of like, look over in that general direction, and you see that there’s like, 5 orcs coming this way. 6 orcs. And they all have… it’s… They all have toys like attached to their armor? 
Keith: Oh my-
Austin: Their gimmick is toys. [Keith laughs] From like, the toy archive. 
Keith: The Toy Soldiers?
Jack: Fuck those guys. I had to deal with those guys once.
[1:00:15]
Austin: So, they’re like the Toy Soldiers. Yeah, they’re the Toy Soldiers.
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: And they’re like… they have like, face paint on that makes them look like… like you know? Toy Soldiers. They have like, the big hats on. They have um, real weapons, for sure. But you get the feeling like-
Keith: So, it’s like a Nutcracker Gang?
Austin: Yeah, it’s like a Nutcracker Team. But there is definitely a mage who has like marionettes. Who is doing some sort of weird marionette magic. Um, and they definitely-
Keith: Now, what halfling do you think that mage is?
Austin: Yeah, I- we could see, you know? There’s a lot of halflings out there at this point still. Um, but is doing pattern magic with two marionette dolls, basically. Like, it’s not like you know, a voodoo doll or something. It’s literally the way that Lem played the violin, they are playing the mario- like two marionette puppets.
Jack: God, you can do pattern magic with anything.
Austin: You can do it with anything. 
Jack: It sucks. 
Austin: Yeah. Uh huh.
Keith: I’m… I tell the bird-
Jack (as Lem): Ok, Fero. 
Jack: Yeah, I was gonna say we should communicate this to the bird.
Keith (as Fero): Excu- 
Keith: I’m… I’m communicating to the bird in you know, in bird talk.
Austin: What do you say?
Keith (as Fero): That water’s not safe. You have to move.
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Oh, this water is so nice. 
Keith (as Fero): It’s really not safe. That water is predatory water. 
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Hm, water.
Austin: And like, does a little like shoulder… You know, it’s like cleaning itself in the water. 
Keith (as Fero): No, not safe. Bad water. 
Austin: Give me a Parlay. 
Keith: Par- Gotta parlay with a Cartwright’s wren. Ok. 
Jack: God, it’s fuckin’ birds, soups, and nuts today. 
Keith: Three. [laughs hard]
Austin: When you have leverage on a GM character and manipulate them, roll + charisma. Leverage is something-
Jack: Oh no. 
Austin: Uh…
Jack: Is there any way-
Austin: It dives into the water. Um, and then-
Keith: [laughing] This bird is so dumb!
Austin: It’s a bird! Uh, and the mouth closes around it. Like-
Jack: This is an intelligence bird. Oh my god. 
Austin: Uh, it’s not dead yet. But the mouth closed, for sure. And it sounds like a bear trap closing. 
Keith: I’m going to go wrestle with the plant. 
Jack: Do we just hear the bird go, ‘Oh no!’ [laughs]
Keith: I’m gonna go wrestle the plant. 
Austin: Give me a Defy Danger strength. 
Keith: 8.
Austin: That is an 8. Um, so you hesitate, uh… or you hesitate, uh sorry. It’s not hesitate. That’s the wrong- worst outcome, hard bargain, ugly choice. God damn. So yeah, you’re… you’re like, pulling it open. You’re-
Keith: Oh, wait. Hold on. 
Austin: What’s up? You have plus one forward.
Keith: If we- I have plus one forward and-
Austin: That’s true. Oh no, you don’t. You don’t cause that would have… that would have been blown on the parlay unfortunately. 
Keith: The parlay. Got it. 
Austin: Which would have got you up to a 4.
Keith: Great. 
[overlapping]
Austin: Yeah, I don’t think there’s any- you can’t aid-
Keith: I’m starting to resent that 13 and then the two 11s.
Austin: [laughs] Uh, make sure your taking XP for failed rolls, by the way, people.
Keith: Got it. 
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: Cause there’s some failed ones this episode. Um, you’re able to get this thing open, but it’s gonna get its- You can free the bird, but it’s going to get your arm instead. 
Keith: Take my whole arm?
Austin: Not take it off, but like...
Keith: Hurt my arm. 
Austin: ...it’s gonna be in there. It’s gonna- I’m gonna roll damage, and then it’s gonna be in there, and you’re gonna have to try to struggle to get it out. 
Keith: Deal.
Austin: But the bird will fly out. 
Keith: Deal. 
Austin: Um, alright. I’m gonna do damage. Three damage. 
Keith: Three damage? Does this ignore armor?
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Because this is like biting into your arm with its weird, acid mouth-like shit. 
Keith: Ok. And I-
Austin: Like the- It’s not even acid, it’s just- It boils the water.
Keith: How- Now here’s the thing. How do I keep track of shed in this new system?
Austin: Good question. 
Keith: Of- No, not shed. Shed is… Is that what it is? No, not Shed. 
Austin: Balance. 
Keith: It’s Balance, yeah. [in the background] Where is that?
Austin: Yeah, um…
Ali: I’ve been keeping track of my peace in just the look box because it’s like, on top and huge.
Austin: Um, let me see that-
Keith: I guess I can just do- In the name, I can do a number.
Austin: You can do that, but there’s also- Here, there’s also just like, um, do you see this thing I just added?
Ali: Uh huh. 
Keith: Yeah. Balan- oh awesome. Balance one. This is my-
Austin: Which balance do you have? Boom.
Keith: I probably actually have more than that, but I haven’t been keeping track. 
Austin: Yeah, that’s fine. So, take one. So, Hella, in the bottom under your race move, there’s a thing called Global Modifiers. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: You can just add a little thing there that’ll be a little spot. Look would also work. That’s also a good place for just notes, you know? So, are you spending that balance to take, to res- to… heal yourself?
Keith: I’m not doing anything yet. No. 
Austin: Ok. Ok. 
Keith: I was at full health. I’ve got 17. 
Austin: Um, Hella? How’s your conversation going?
Ali: Hm. Great. Uh [laughs] I feel like they’re… Before we cut, there was an aspect of that conversation of Hella being like, ‘If you want to figure stuff out…
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Ali: ... come figure stuff out with a bunch of magicians. But I think that she also is curious about knowing, like, how many people are here exactly. Um… 
Austin: Like-
Ali: Are they really just playing games? Um… Things of that nature. 
Austin: No. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think he- I mean, he explains to you. The answer is no, right? Like, it has be- There are working Archivists who come into this area to try to recover stuff. And there are bandits who have set up camp, who rob the Archivists who try to come into the area. And who fight each other over territory. 
Keith: And some of the bandits also used to be Archivists.
Austin: Many of them used to be. 
Keith: Right. 
Austin: And some of them- eh, I want to be clear. There are not only orc… orcish gangs here. There are other, you know, cultures here for sure. But the… but the bulk of them are orcish because this is the New Archives, right? And there’s people that, you know- There are absolutely gangs that have you know, mixed species. Mixed culture makeup. Um, Isaac is just very neurotic about stuff. And he gives you like, the big picture on all that stuff. And he’s also intrigued by this. And then there is the sound of the drum. Um, and he goes,
Austin (as Isaac): Well, ok. Wait a second. Who’s that coming for us? What is happening here? Is this one of your- Is this a ploy, Miss Hella?
Ali (as Hella): No. 
Austin (as Isaac): Is it your drum? Is it you drummin’?
Ali (as Hella): We’ve had this great conversation. I don’t drum. 
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah, but maybe it was… It’s a whole… it’s a whole, you know- Yo, I’m a magician. I know all about misdirection. 
Ali: She puts her hands up like…
Austin (as Isaac): Let me see what’s in your sleeves. No, drum sticks in there, I hope. I’m fuckin’ with you. That’s the- that’s the Toy Soldiers. They’re gonna come. They must have see us runnin’ out of here. This is what I’m talkin’ about. This is good territory. There’s stuff in here to eat. There’s stuff in here to drink. You know, it’s a little dangerous sometimes, but you know what it is. The point is, we gotta get goin’. 
Ali (as Hella): Are they in trouble?
Austin (as Isaac): The Toy Soldiers? [Keith laughs]
Ali (as Hella): Lem and Fero. 
Austin (as Isaac): Like wanderin’ around in here, yeah probably. Everyone’s in trouble. Heat and the Dark, right?
Ali (as Hella): Can I be real with you for a second?
Austin (as Isaac): I thought we were being real. 
Ali (as Hella): We are. They’re super not into you, and I kind of think that you’re cool. If you-
Austin (as Isaac): Oh. [laughs lightly]
Ali (as Hella): Yeah, this has been nice. If you, if we run in there and like, save them, they’re not gonna like curse you out on the way back. 
Austin (as Isaac): On the way back where?
Ali (as Hella): You don’t want to come to the university and meet all those magicians I told you about?
Austin (as Isaac): I mean, that seems alright, but you know, I’ve been to that university. I studied at that university. For years. You want me to go back there, that’s like, bad memories. That’s like-
Ali (as Hella): Yeah, well, there’s like, a bunch of like- There’s students there. There’s new people who like, want to go there and learn. If you went there, oh my god. If you went there and said that you were a student there ages ago, you would be a king. 
Austin (as Isaac): That wouldn't be like one of those situations where like, you just like, hanging around out front of the school when you like, graduated four years ago, but you’re still hanging out there cause your life hasn’t changed too much.
Ali (as Hella): No. No, no, no. No, no, no. 
Austin (as Isaac): It woudn’t be like that. 
Ali (as Hella): Look at the world. There’s holes in the ground everywhere. Anyone who says they can do anything-
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah. Ok. I- 
Austin: [in Isaac’s voice still] Give me a parlay. [Keith and Ali laugh hard] Um, roll charisma. 
Ali: I’m- Ok. Can I just say that I’m so glad that I secretly spent 2 years putting so much into charisma?
Austin: Yeah. I know. 
Ali: Cause I always thought of Hella as someone to be able to like, sit down at a bar and like, talk to someone openly. 
Austin: Yeah. Totally. 
Ali: Um, and that was an 8. 
Austin: That’s an 8. So, I think… So that means that you- they need some concrete assurance of your promise right now. Um, [sighs] I think he’s like, 
Austin (as Isaac): Alright, but like, I need- Do you have some way of bein’ like, ‘You know what? This guy? He’s good.’ Do you have like a… like we get like a cool… like a handshake or like a… like a friendship bracelet? Or um… you know, like… like a heart locket? Or-
Ali (as Hella): Those are pretty firm commitments that I’m not… We’re not jewelry yet. Um...
Austin (as Isaac): Oh, that’s good. I like that. I like that phrase. That’s a good phrase. Yeah. ‘Two of us? We go back. We’re like jewelry.’ I like it. 
Ali (as Hella): [laughing] See. You should hang out with me. That is my concrete assurance that I am a cool person. And that if you are seen with me...
Austin (as Isaac): No, but I just want-
Ali (as Hella): ...you will have an in.
Austin (as Isaac): You did laugh at my joke. Like, you actually did that. That’s not normal. [Keith laughs hard] No, I’m not sayin’ you’re not normal. That’s not what I mean. [Ali laughs] 
Keith: That’s fuckin’ weird you laughed.[Austin and Ali laugh]
Austin: [in Isaac’s voice] I said some bullshit, and you thought it was funny, that’s weird. [Keith laughs hard]
Keith: Fero hates Isaac, but I- Isaac is so funny.
Austin: He’s had a decade, you know? Um, god. 
Keith: Reminder that Isaac like, helped orchestrate the like, trick-
Austin: Oh yeah. 
Keith: The tricking of all of the people in Rosemerrow into thinking that they didn’t steal all their shit from the gnolls. 
Austin: Yes. He’s a bad- He was a bad person. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: For a long time. He might still be one. 
Jack: He had a r- He did bad stuff in the museum, etcetera. 
Keith: He did ask for his- he did ask for his staff back in a way that was like, [using a different voice] ‘Let me see my staff. And we’ll just still be hanging out. And I’ll still be your prisoner.’
Austin: ‘Yo, pass me that gun.’ Um, he says, like, 
Austin (as Isaac): Alright, but you gotta- If they pick on me, you gotta tell them to cut it out. 
Ali (as Hella): That’s it?
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah, you’re big. They’ll listen. 
Ali (as Hella): Oh, yeah. Ok. Sure. Yeah. I- Who’s gonna make fun of you?
Austin (as Isaac): Also, give me that dagger. That dagger seems cool. 
Ali (as Hella): Shut up. [Keith laughs]
Austin (as Isaac): I’m serious. It’s a cool dagger. What are use- You got that cool sword. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah, the dagger’s backup. It’s the coolest dagger I have. 
Austin (as Isaac): And now- Hey, listen. Wait. And now I’m backup. Hm?
Ali (as Hella): [laughing] Ok, again. Not jewelry yet. 
Austin (as Isaac): Ok, that- I thought maybe a dagger wasn’t quite jewelry. 
Austin: The drums are getting closer. [Austin and Ali laugh]
Ali (as Hella): If you- Is this just like a ‘you want to defend yourself in this moment’ thing?
Austin (as Isaac): No, it’s a thing that’d be like, Hella the Queen Killer and Isaac Adelton, the Mystic Mage of Illusion team up once again. You could just tell them ‘once again’, they don’t need to know we didn’t do it before. 
Ali (as Hella): [sighs] Ok, fine. But if you get up to any shit in my fucking home…this deal is over.
Austin (as Isaac): Woah, woah, woah, what is the- What is this energy? This is a whole new energy from you. I don’t want any smoke. This is not- 
Ali (as Hella): I’m just saying, these are the kind of energies that you get, and if you want me to use this exact tone with someone else in your defense…
Austin (as Isaac): Which I do.
Ali (as Hella): ...I’m asking you for some concrete assurance of your promise. 
Austin (as Isaac): Alright. Let’s go find your friends. Let’s make sure they’re ok. And then get out of here before the Toy Soldiers get here. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. Ok. 
Austin: Hey, how’s it goin’, plant friends?
Keith: I have my arm inside of a carnivorous puddle. 
Austin: Lem? What are you doing while your- while Fero has that happening?
Jack: Oh, Jesus. Right. This is probably machete time, I think. 
Austin: Oh probably.
Jack: Um, I think I’m gonna try and-
Keith: Oh, is there roots? 
Keith (as Fero): Hey! Can you check and see if this has roots?
Austin: It- Yeah, it has roots. 
Jack: Wouldn’t they be undergr- [laughs]
Austin: They’d yeah… They’d go underground. 
Keith: Well, you know, some trees and stuff have roots, and vines have roots you can see. And- you know? Groundcover.
Austin: Uh huh. 
Jack: Ok, the bird is out. I don’t need to kill this plant, I just need it to… to open up its mouth for long enough...
Austin: That’s true. 
Jack: ... to free Fero. 
Austin: That’s true. 
Jack: Um, so I’m just gonna hit it as hard as I can. Um… being clear to you know, aim it a bit… Ah, this is a messy weapon
Austin: It is a messy weapon. 
Jack: Probably gonna try and aim it a bit- Austin. No, Austin, I see what you’re thinking. [laughs]
Austin: That’s why there are tags. This is why there are tags. Maybe consider doing something else if you don’t want to risk the messiness getting involved, you know?
Jack: Ok, I’m gonna look Fero dead in the eye and say, 
Keith: Yes.
Jack (as Lem): Fero, if I use this, I might hit your arm. 
Keith (as Fero): Don’t use it.
Jack (as Lem): Do you want me to use this?
Keith (as Fero): No, don’t use that.
Jack (as Lem): Oh, ok. 
Keith (as Fero): This thing barely hurts. The axe will hurt.
Jack (as Lem): Sure. Fine. Ok. 
Jack: Um… Alright. I’m gonna plunge the rapier into it. Like in a very- like a pin- like a point where I know Fero’s arm isn’t. 
Austin: Ok. Give me a Hack and Slash. 
Jack: But this is a dexterity thing. 
Austin: It is. Your dexterity is what? One? Plus one?
Jack: Zero. 
Austin: Zero. Good. 
Jack: I’m trying. I’m trying. 
Austin: That’s an 8. 
Jack: Ok, I’m trying ok. 
Austin: Yeah, ok. Um, yeah. You plunge it through, and I think it like, as you do, a vine like, swings up and wraps around your arm. And you’re like, trying to pull the rapier out, and it’s like squeezing your, um, your arm. So, I’m gonna do a little bit of damage to you. We’ll see. 
Jack: Ok.
Keith: But my arm’s out free and then I can-
Austin: You’re arm is now free. 
Keith: I’m going to now sever… Lem’s arm. No, the vine. [laughs]
Austin: The- Oh my god. Uh, yeah. Totally. That’s fine. Like the- you’ve done enough damage. Lem, take 5 from this vine. 
Jack: Ok. 
Austin: Which is like, really tight around your arm. 
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: And then, yeah, you’re able to cut the vine, Fero. And now the bird is like, free and is like, 
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Bad water. 
Keith (as Fero): Bad water. Yes. 
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Bad water. 
Keith (as Fero): Hey.
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): You were right. Bad water.
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. Bad water. I’m sorry about that. Are you good now?
[1:15:00]
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Like water. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, I have some water. Do you want some of my Safewater?
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Safewater?
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, Safewater.
Austin: [foley] ‘Swwoo’ Flies down.
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Safewater. 
Keith: Give like a lid full from a water skin. 
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): [foley of sipping] Safewater. 
Keith (as Fero): Sa- Yeah. Safewater. Pretty good, right?
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Hm, Safewater. 
Keith (as Fero): You wanna- hang out with us for a bit? I’ve got food. Do you want some food?
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Safe food?
Keith (as Fero): Safe food. Yeah. 
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Safe food. 
Keith (as Fero): Safe, real safe food. Here. 
Austin: Give me- give me a parlay. 
Keith: God, another parlay. Jesus Christ. 
Austin: Uh huh. We’re just in it today. 
Keith: Alright. Everybody, uh wish me luck. 
Austin: Get a good-
Keith: That’s a 5. 
Austin: My god. 
Ali: No. 
Jack: Can I help?
Keith: No, you can’t. 
Austin: You’re off by two. Um, god, is there any way to get you there?
Jack: What if both of us help?
Austin: That’s not how it works. 
Keith: Leverage is something the character needs or wants. Food. Lots of food. 
Austin: No, you don’t- You don’t have a plus one to anything else, do you? Um…
Keith: I’ve. Wait, but isn’t- Can’t I… can’t I… Can’t I fulfill this?
Austin: Yeah, but it’s a fail. The roll is a fail. 
Keith: Oh, the roll is a fail. Got it. 
Austin: Yeah. Um…
Keith: I thought- It said in the details…
Jack: [overlapped] This whole fucking detour-
Keith: ...I thought it was saying that I could still do it. 
Austin: Right, no. I’m just- I’m looking through all of your moves to be like, is there any way to get a plus one.
Jack: [overlapped] Fero just doesn’t talk good to birds. 
Austin: You just don’t. 
Keith: Well, I um… 
Austin: Hmm… hmmm… Cause you don’t need to eat or drink. Shapeshifter, that’s not really gonna do it for you cause you’re already a- thing. Uh…
Keith: What if I show it that I’m also a bird?
Austin: Yeah, so I think that the thing here is like, this is- this is… I think it’s like, ‘safe food’ and it eats your food. And it’s like, ‘Alright, thanks. Bye.’ Um, and at this point, Isaac and Hella show up. But also, you can hear that the Toy Soldiers are here. Not here with you, with you. But here in the building. So, that is the- that is the move I’m making in terms of like, this is taking more time than you want it to.
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: And you’ll need- you’ll need to offer it something that isn’t just food and water. That is the- that is the fail on that parlay. It’s not like, ‘and then they’ll never be your friend.’ It’s like, that is not- That is not what it needs to like, come with you. 
Keith: Uh huh. 
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Good food. Good water. Bye.
Keith (as Fero): Shelter.
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Shelter. Free.
Keith (as Fero): Safe.
Austin (as Isaac): Hey, what’s goin’ on over here? What’s- What are you guys-? Are you talkin’ to a bird? Why you talkin’ to a bird that-?
Keith (as Fero): Shut up. Shut up. This is the-
[crosstalk]
Austin (as Isaac): It's just a stupid, little bird.
Ali (as Hella): Hey, hey, hey, hey.
Keith (as Fero): Isaac, shut your dumb-
Austin (as Isaac): What’s-?
Ali (as Hella): Just let him-
Austin (as Isaac): Ok. Ok. 
Ali (as Hella): He’s a bird talk- just let him.
Austin (as Isaac): He’s a bird talker? He talks to birds?
Ali (as Hella): If you’re gonna hang out with Fero, you’re gonna have to get used to this, so shut up.
Austin (as Isaac): But- Hey, Fero. Good luck with the bird talking. 
Keith (as Fero): Thank you. Shut up. 
Austin (as Isaac): I’ll be quiet. Ok, ok. Ok.
Keith: Um…
Ali (as Hella): Yo, Lem
Jack (as Lem): Yeah?
Ali (as Hella): This dude says that that- whatever that noise is might be bad. 
Jack (as Lem): Oh, ok. Fero?
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Jack (as Lem): I don’t mean to you know, hasten things along here cause I know that you’re kind of having some difficulty with the bird. 
Keith (as Fero): Yes. 
Jack (as Lem): Um, but there are some people coming. And we want to be out of here before they get here. 
Keith (as Fero): Ok.
Jack (as Lem): So, if there’s any way I can kind of help with the bird…
Keith (as Fero): Can you talk to birds?
Jack (as Lem): No, I can’t. Um...
Keith (as Fero): Do you think- Here’s the thing. The bird is much more aware of my personal social deficiencies than I- than I would have expected. [Austin and Jack laugh quietly]
Ali (as Hella): Do you want me to buy you some time?
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. 
Ali (as Hella): Ok. Will do. 
Austin (as Isaac): Where are we goin’?
Ali: And I think she like, firm elbow into Isaac, which is like, ‘We’re gonna do this now.’
Austin (as Isaac): What are we doin’? What are we- [whispering] What are we doin’? I don’t want to get yelled at again. What are we doin’? [Keith and Ali laugh]
Ali (as Hella): We’re gonna go- we’re gonna go take care of the Toy Soldiers ourselves. Fero has- is busy. 
Austin (as Isaac): [whispering] We’re gonna take care of the Toy Soldiers? They’re our rivals.
Ali (as Hella): Did you see what I fuckin’ did to y’all?
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah, but there’s no-
Ali (as Hella): If those are your rivals, [laughs] we’re gonna be fine.
Austin: [laughs] Ohhh ok. [Jack laughs] Alright. [Ali laughs]
Keith: Also, but like, totally fair, right?
Jack: An interesting ultimatum. 
Austin: Yeah, totally fair. But also- Alright, y’all head back toward the Toy Soldiers. And they are like, lounging already back. They’re like, kicking over the broken ship. They’re like, really, truly just like, havin’ one. One of them is definitely drinking already. The mage is not. The mage is working the pattern with the marionettes, as the rest of the Toy Soldiers like, have quickly been like, ‘Ah, this is the life.’
Ali: Can I ask Isaac about that? Does he know any of the-?
Austin: [using Isaac’s voice] She’s probably scannin’ for us. Scanning isn’t a word I would use because it’s a future word.
[whispering]
Austin (as Isaac): She’s probably tryin’ to sense us out. We gotta be quiet.
Ali (as Hella): She can do that?
Austin (as Isaac): I don’t know. She’s like a mage. She’s doin’ something. 
Ali (as Hella): You’re a mage. 
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah, but I do different stuff. Oh! That’s what I should do. One second. Stand very still. 
Ali (as Hella): Ok. 
Austin: And he does like, a very basic stealth spell on y’all. He doesn’t have a staff, so he can’t do, like, great magic, but like, he can do- he’s basically like, quieted your footsteps and protected you from- from like, the reaches of her detect spell.
Ali (as Hella): Hell yeah. Big ups to Isaac. 
[whispering]
Austin (as Isaac): Shh, shh, shh. 
Ali (as Hella): Oh, sorry. 
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah, big ups to me. Alright.
Ali (as Hella): So, do you think that this should be like- Should we get first attack here or should we just let them-
Austin (as Isaac): How bout this? How bout this?
Ali (as Hella): Ok.
Austin (as Isaac): How bout this? You know how the- right. Stage whispers. You know how we, the- sorry. You know how the Toy Soldiers are the Bird- are the rivals of us, the Bird Boys? 
Ali (as Hella): Uh huh. 
Austin (as Isaac): You know that. 
Ali (as Hella): Uh huh.
Austin (as Isaac): Well, the thing is, the… the- It’s not really reciprocal in that way. The Toy Soldiers have their own, different rivals also. [Keith laughs] And that is the Cabinet Crew.
Ali (as Hella): Oh my god. [Keith laughs hard]
Austin (as Isaac): So, we could make it seem like the Cabinet Crew was comin’ through. Which rhymed, which I wasn’t- not intentional. Then, that could distract ‘em. And then we could just charge ‘em. And get ‘em while they’re distracted. 
Ali (as Hella): What’s the- what’s the Cabinet Crew do?
Austin (as Isaac): They bang cabinets, I guess. 
Ali (as Hella): What?
Austin (as Isaac): They like, open and shut.
[Everyone laughs hard]
Jack: Yes, Austin? [Keith laughs again] What’s that, Austin?
Austin (as Isaac): They like, open and shut.
Keith: How lucky was it that we stumbled upon a place that you had totally prepared for? [Ali laughs]
Austin: So, I knew Adelton was somewhere. And I knew- Hm.
Austin (as Isaac): So, they open and shut cabinets rapidly really loudly. 
Ali (as Hella): Ok. 
Austin (as Isaac): It’s like, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
Ali (as Hella): Can you- can you make that noise like, magically?
Austin: He puts his hands up to his mouth. [laughing]
Austin (as Isaac): You gotta trust me. You ready?
Ali (as Hella): I do, but I swear to god.
Austin (as Isaac): [loudly] Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. [Keith laughs] Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang, bang. 
Austin: And it magically you know, ventriloquist style- He throws his voice to outside. And it- they like, jump up. And one of them goes, 
Austin (as unnamed Crew member): That’s the Cabinet Crew!
Austin: And draws a blade. And two of them rush outside, and the other two take up positions. And the marionette mage continues to do her thing. What do you do, Hella Varal?
Ali: I… Hm… What’s the full vibe that I’m getting from this mage? How is- Ok. [laughs]
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: This should be-
Keith: How good is this mage?
Ali: [overlapped] I’m gonna-
Austin: She’s a good- No, go ahead.
Ali: I- Cause I’m really- I’m… this is probably gonna be a Discern, but like…
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: ...I feel- Is there-? The detachment from the action of everybody else, is this a- ‘the thing that I’m doing is important’ or is it ‘my goals are different’?
Austin: It’s ‘the thing I’m doing’. It’s both. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: It’s ‘the thing I’m doing is important’, and also ‘unlike these fuck- fuckin’ like, fuckin’ headasses, like I’m actually tryin’ to make sure we’re safe’. 
Ali: Ok, right.
Austin: Like, she’s doing her job. Which is you know, even if- like, she’s almost in a similar role as Adelton was, which is like, she might not be in charge of this gang, but she’s in charge of this gang.
Ali: Ok, ok. 
Austin: This gang doesn’t work without her. She’s probably been through it with like, four different leaders at this point, but she’s the one who’s made it through, you know? 
Ali: Ok. I just wanted to get a sense if there was like, a different motivation…
Austin: Un, un. 
Ali: ... at play here. Which it would be allowed to just be like, “hey, what’s this person up to?’, but regardless.
Austin: Yeah, like I could with something if that’s where it was going…
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: ...but we’re not- We don’t need to do all that.
Ali: Ok, yeah. Um, in that case, yeah. I mean, Isaac’s plan seems pretty solid, which is like, we’re pretending we’re these other people. And then, springing up on them. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: Um, I… I feel like she’s gonna like- Also, just like, so clearly through this conversation of being like, ‘Well, we all hang out. There’s a flower gang.’ She’s like, really not gonna draw her sword today, probably. Um [laughs]
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: But it is also a very specific like, jump out. Cause fear. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Make people run away so Lem and Fero are safe. 
Austin: Alright. Give me that roll then. 
Ali: What is that roll? Is that like a Defy Danger at this point, I guess?
Austin: That’s- No, no. Oh, are you not actually going to cause fear?
Ali: Oh, I guess I could do that, too.
Austin: Yeah, you do have that with the-
Ali: Right.
Keith: Oh, you meant cause fear like, ‘I’m going to intimidate them into being afraid. 
Austin: Yeah, I thought you meant Road to Perdition again. But- but yeah. You can also just try to do the intimidation thing, but that again would probably be charisma. 
Ali: Oh sure. I mean if you’re-
Austin: This is gonna be a charisma roll no matter what. Or again, it would be parlay. And again, the thing that you’re parlaying is their lives.
Ali: So, yeah. I would- I um, would love to drop-
Austin: Yeah, you- basically it’s like, yeah. Do you want to do this with Road to Perdition or do you want to do this with parlay?
Ali: Um…
Austin: Do you want to do this with like, ‘I’m magic’? Or do you want to do this with like, ‘Get the fuck out of here.’
Ali: They’re both so much fun. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: Um, I think it’s gonna be a parlay again. I- It feels a little boring, but I don’t know that that is the moment that Hella is pulling out the-
Austin: Yeah, that’s fair. Give me the charisma. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: And tell me what you say. 
Ali: Oh, I have to say something. Right. 
Austin: Yeah.
Ali: I like- She just- Specifically just been like, ‘I want these people to be afraid of me.’ That I think of the gesture of like, being a strong person as enough. Um, she says something cool. It’s like, you know,
Ali (as Hella): The cabinet isn’t the only… thing you have to worry about. 
Ali: I was gonna say ‘the only drawer you have to worry about’. That doesn’t make any sense. 
Austin: [overlapped] No, it really doesn’t.
Ali: [laughs] If you think that there’s a word that fits in there, audience at home, you can put it in. But that’s the thing that she’s um, um…
Austin: Ok, give me a roll. 
Ali: And that’s a 9. Again.
Austin: That’s a 9. Um, alright. So, you need to- This is the thing again. You need to show that that’s true.
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: I think she turns to you with the marionette and like, as soon as she does, you can see- You can sense a like, a darkening presence around all of you. As if like, she’s trying to reassert that she’s in control here. So, you need to do something to actually threaten- like to follow through on that threat, basically. 
Ali: Hm- Is there like -this just popped into my head- Is there like a lantern or anything in the wreckage? Like something that could like- the idea here is that if like, she’s causing like a dark magic spell…
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: ...I want to like, knock something over and like, make a big flash of light or like, cause a…. I don’t know if that’s allowed.
Austin: Yeah. What’s the thing that you want to do?
Ali: Like cause a fire? Uh. 
Austin: Hm.
Jack: Hmmm.
Ali: No, no. I meant just of the wreckage, but we don’t have to get too out of hand here. Um…
Austin: Yeah, you don’t want to cause a fire? You don’t think that would add to this moment? I just need that lever- I need to see the leverage here. I need to know what that is.
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: Or I need the assurance-
Ali: No, it’s the thing that I said it was. Which is like-
Austin: You were gonna do- You’re gonna like, smash a lantern? You’re gonna like-?
Ali: Yeah, just be like, ‘You can’t make things dark. I control to light. And I will fight you.’ Like-
Austin: Alright. Give- Give me a Defy Danger to make sure this doesn’t go bad.
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: That’s Defy Danger dex. Yeah. 
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: Plus one. 
Ali: I talked too much tonight.
Austin: You did. It’s good. I love it. 
Ali: Fuck. Ok. It’s that button. 
Austin: Plus one. 2d6 +1.
Ali: [sighs] Oh my god. What the fuck. 
Austin: That’s a 5. So, you throw the lantern down. It smashes. It catches fire on the ground. And like, some… some loose like, some like, dry grass catches. Um, and then like, her dark magic just swallows it whole. 
Keith: And wait. And snuffs it out?
Austin: Well, you just can’t see it anymore. Lem and Fero, the jungle yells.
Keith: Yells what?
Austin: And I know what you’re thinking, how does- how do the plants yell? Well, it’s… there’s just like a- It’s almost like, I- gasp into a microphone, and then turn it up as high as you can. 
Keith: Got it. 
Austin: Um, and that is because there is weird fire spreading through part this jungle now. What are you two up to?
Keith: I’m talking to the bird. 
Austin: Uh huh. Lem, did you- 
Jack: [exhales] Kind of-
Austin: It sounded like you had a solution. Or you you had like, a thing you wanted to try. 
Keith: Oh yeah. Sorry. Yeah. 
Jack: I mean, I- [sighs] 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Jack: I’m remembering… [sighs] How did we maneuver the birds during the Twenty-two Brown Birds…
Austin: You didn’t. 
Jack: ...approach?
Austin: You didn’t. 
Jack: We just- just didn’t-? That didn’t-?
Austin: Sometimes there’s twenty-two brown birds.
Jack: Yep, sometimes there is. Ok, so this isn’t really- [laughs] Ok, right. Um, I mean-
Austin: There is a very silly thing you can do to help here. I don’t know if you’ve seen this. 
Keith: Seen what?
Austin: It might be too much like a bard for you to want to do it. 
Jack: Oh, to do the like, um, to do the… What’s her name? The Disney princess who sings and-
[1:30:00]
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: What’s the princess?
Ali: Snow White.
Jack: Snow White, who sings.
Austin: So, what it- It’s actually a weird thing because it would be like, you weren’t- It’s not that you’re singing. It’s that Fero is singing, and that you are the backing band. You have Arcane Art, which gives you, the next time someone successfully assists the target that you’re targeting with Arcane Art, with aid, they get plus 2, instead of plus 1. Which would like, set the groundwork for another parlay attempt. In a way that’s like, gives you a little bit more wiggle room with you’re aid, you know?
Jack: Yeah. 
Austin: Um, and this is not a roll we do that often. So, it’s not that we’ve-
Jack: No. 
Austin: I don’t think we’ve ever used that ability as part of Arcane Art ever. 
Jack: Right. It’s- it’s specifically setting up something like this, right?
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. Or it’s- I mean, in Dungeons and Dragons, what it is is casting a spell that means the next time someone helps you, you get- helps your target, they get a bonus. Like, it isn’t- It is not as clean as this would be. Um, in terms of like, ‘Ah, yes. The music is helping along the convincing.’ But here, it would be doing that.
Jack: Um, ok. Yeah. I’m prepared to this. [overlapped] Um, It’s- 
Austin: What’s it look like? How do you convince Fero like- ‘Ok, let me just play this violin.’
Jack: I think that’s,
Jack (as Lem): Ok, Fero. I’m gonna play the violin now. 
Keith (as Fero): Ok.
Austin: Ok. Yeah, good. 
Jack (as Lem): We’re all good here?
Keith (as Fero): Is that gonna help me?
Jack (as Lem): I mean, I hope so. 
Keith (as Fero): Or are you bored?
Jack (as Lem): No, no. It should help you.
Keith (as Fero): Ok, so this is to help. Ok. Got it. Then yes. 
Jack (as Lem): I mean, like… you know, I haven’t always had the best track record with this, but uh… [sighs] You know, we can give it a shot. 
Keith (as Fero): I’m- I mean, I haven’t been doing a great job.
Jack (as Lem): Is this worth it?
Keith (as Fero): You mean, getting the bird?
Jack (as Lem): Yeah.
Keith (as Fero): I really- I mean, we crashed the thing to get here, so yeah. 
Jack (as Lem): Yeah, but are we throwing you know, good money after bad here?
Keith (as Fero): No. 
Jack (as Lem): Just so long as you’re sure about that.
Keith (as Fero): I mean, getting the bird is good. Is there- is there- Hold on. Is there a dire consequence to this spell not working?
Jack (as Lem): You know, sometimes I play the violin and destroy my homeland. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. [pauses] And sometimes you move a boat for no reason, and it makes a huge noise, and we have to run from a double-plant monster. 
Jack (as Lem): Right. So, I’m saying, kind of, is this worth it?
Keith (as Fero): Yes. 
Jack (as Lem): And you can say that in your head and your heart?
Keith (as Fero): Both at the same time. 
Jack (as Lem): Ok. 
Austin: Give me the- give me the roll. Charisma. 2d6 + 2. That’s an 11. Alright. So, what’s this music sounds like?
Jack: It sounds like um… I mean, so I’m always really cautious about describing the way Lem plays because on the one hand, you know, the thing that’s interesting about it is is that he’s just very good at playing the violin. 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah.
Jack: But it’s also magic. And that there is magic here. So, I think that- You know when you hear music through a wall and you listen to it, and you’re like, “oh, I know what song that is.’ But it takes you like, a moment. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Jack: Um, I think what we hear is the sound of a- of a full working aviary with people coming to feed the birds and give them fresh water and make sure that things are clean. And you know, take care of them. These- these Archivists who…
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: ...canonically are assholes. The bird people, they suck. Lem doesn’t like them. But they take care of these- They take care of these birds.
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: And I think that’s what we hear. We hear that first, and then it’s- when you listen to it, you’re like, ‘Oh, right. This is a violin playing.’ But that’s not what you think of first. That’s not what you hear kind of in the moment. 
Austin: Ok. Fero, this is playing. Give me your shot. What are you- What’s the new- what’s the new pitch to Cartwright’s Wren?
Keith: Oh, I thought I had to sing a song. 
Austin: You don’t have to sing a song.
Jack: Lem, just like… like, brief concern and panic on Lem’s voice.
Keith (as Fero): Does it have to be- does it have to be- Can it be instrumental or do I need to- do I need to say?
Jack (as Lem): You don’t have to say it, Fero. 
Keith (as Fero): Do I need to sing?
Jack (as Lem): No, you don’t- Just talk to the bird.
Keith (as Fero): Hello, bird. I’m back.
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Hello. Safe. Safewater. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, Safewater. That’s me. 
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Safewater. 
Keith (as Fero): Uh huh. Um, I know a place with lots of Safewater and safe shelter. 
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): More.
Keith (as Fero): More, yeah. More water. More food. All safe. 
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Far place?
Keith (as Fero): A little far place. 
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Little far place. Hm, little far place. 
Keith (as Fero): Fun place.
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Fun place.
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Big place?
Keith (as Fero): Pretty big place. 
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Pretty big place. 
Jack: God, I love this bird. I’d die for this bird. [Austin, Keith, and Ali laughs]
Austin: Give me a- give me a parlay. Here we go. 
Keith: Alright. 
Austin: That’s a 8.
Keith: 8. 
Austin: So, here’s the thing. Jack, give me the Aid, Interfere.
Keith: And now, it’s plus 2. 
Austin: That’s plus 2. Which that would go from 8 to a 10. Yeah.
Jack: If I succeed. 
Austin: That’s a success. Plus 2. 
Jack: [laughing] ...which I did.
Ali: Oooh.
Austin: So,
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Pretty big place. Pretty big place!
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. Pretty… pretty, pretty big place. 
Austin: Um, it lands on your shoulder and goes, 
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Safewater. [overlapped] Safewater.
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. Safewater. Do you want some?
.Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): No… Uh…
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, here’s some. 
Austin (as Cartwright’s Wren): Call me Safewater. 
Keith (as Fero): You’re Safwater. 
Austin (as Safewater): I’m Safewater. Safewater. 
Keith (as Fero): Hi, Safewater. 
Austin: Um, alright. You’ve got this bird.We’ll figure out the rules for how it works. I think it’s just like, it can- it gives you a plus one on that roll. 
Jack: Fuckin’ acquired a bird. 
Austin: Acquired a bird. The bird’s name is Safewater. Um, it was either gonna be Safewater or Watch, so… [Ali laughs] Watch is fun, too. 
Keith: Watch is funny. 
Austin: Uh, and yeah. Y’all are good. The music can come to a still. The fire is beginning to spread through this area. 
Ali: [whispered] Oh my god, I’m such a- [Jack laughs] I want to interject. It’s Sleeping Beauty. 
Austin: Thank you. 
Ali: Snow White is often seen with birds, but the....
Austin: Yes.
Ali: …’I Know You’ scene is iconic. Go look it up. Sleeping Beauty is a great movie. 
Jack: Thank you. 
Ali: Anyway…
Austin: Hell yeah. 
Keith: Does Sleeping Beauty- does Snow White not have those little blue birds hanging out?
Ali: She does, but the- the specific singing, dancing, communicating with animals is specifically an Aurora thing. She grew up the woods. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Keith: Oh, ok. Got it. 
Austin: Ok. 
Keith: Who is Aurora?
Ali: She’s…
Austin: Sleeping Beauty. 
Ali: Sleeping Beauty. That’s her name. 
Jack: Sleeping Beauty. 
Ali: Princess Aurora. 
Keith: Oh, I thought her name was Sleeping Beauty. 
Austin: That’s not a name.
Keith: I guess, but it’s Disney. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Keith: So, you know. 
Austin: Isaac is like, 
Austin (as Isaac): We gotta go.
Ali (as Hella): Yeah, we do. 
Ali: Um… I have to like, get out of my- cause like, half of me as a player is like, ‘I should ask him to stop that. Oh, the fire’s gonna go out from the waves anyway. It’s fine.’
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: That is true. Jesus. 
Ali (as Hella): Um, we should go. 
Jack (as Lem): We should go. 
Keith (as Fero): I’m ready to go. 
Ali (as Hella): Oh, you’re back. We’re going. We’re going. We’re going. 
Austin: She’s like using this marionette. She’s like about to cast a spell. Like a bigger spell than this darkness spell. 
Ali: Um, yeah. She is. 
Austin: Do y’all just like, run out a different direction?
Ali: Can I- Hmm… What do I want to do here? My first suggestion was, can I engage with her while everybody else gets away? But I don’t know what that engagement looks like. Beyond actually just like, fighting her.
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: I- I think we just run. 
Ali: Right.
Austin: I think that’s a fair thing to do. 
Ali: Yeah, ok. I was like- I was like, should I parlay again, and now tell them about the thing?
Austin: I- Yeah. 
Jack: Just flee. 
Austin: I think flee.
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: I think- I think that like, parlaying again here… Like, you just don’t have any like- You didn’t follow through. 
Ali: Yeah. Right. Yeah. 
Austin: You made a threat. You did not follow through. 
Ali: This is not a situation where I’d be like- [laughs] Yeah. Um, it wouldn’t be like, ‘By the way, don’t fight me. You’re about to drown.’ But like- That’s not a-
Austin: Right. No. 
Ali: That’s not a Hella thing right now cause she’s forgotten that. Like she’s obviously- [laughs]
Austin: Uh huh. Uh huh. 
Ali: Weird how the moon can fall, and then your day can just change. 
Austin: Could just totally change your whole day. 
Ali: Crash a ship, you forget some stuff. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: Yeah, we’re just leaving. 
Austin: Alright. I’m just gonna let you all escape from this. You know what? Here’s what I’ll do. I’m gonna roll a d4. Y’all go ahead and take 3 damage each, as this like- hands emerge from the darkness as you’re trying to run away and begin to like, heat like- try to peel your soul away. 
Jack: Jesus. 
Austin: Uh, which is just like, ‘That’s not fun.’ Um, but you push through and get out. And like, she isn’t gonna chase you at this point. You fled this area, which is what her goal was. She wants to run this place. 
Keith: Um, Lem, what’s your health at?
Jack: Uh, so that was 3 damage...
Austin: Yeah. 
Jack: ...that we just took?
Keith: Yeah. 
Jack: Uh, my health is at 5. [Ali gasps]
Keith: I- I’m going to heal, Lem. 
Austin: How’s that work?
Keith: I’m going to spend 2 balance. 
Austin: I didn’t realize that could heal other people. 
Keith: I have 2 balance from the two times that we took damage. 
Austin: I think that’s-
Keith: Yes. I can touch people. 
Austin: Wow. Hell yeah. 
Keith: When you touch someone and channel the spirit of your life, you may spend balance. 
Austin: So, you’re gonna spend how much balance?
Keith: Um, 2d4. 
Austin: Can we- can we- can we do this- So, you’re gonna get back to the boat. You get back to the boat; you’re on the boat. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: You’re back in the river. You’re going down river. You’ve gotten it back. Like, you avoid the alligator and the turtle. The moon is getting closer. The night is falling. You- What is the- like, what’s the healing look like? Is it just like, ‘boop, I got you.’ Or is it like-?
Keith: Um, I’m trying to keep it casual. Like- say um, 
Keith (as Fero): Thanks for help with the bird. 
Keith: And I sort of, pat him on the shoulder. And when I do that- ohp, that’s not that works. That doesn’t work right.- And like, when I pat him on the shoulder, it just happens. 
Austin: Ok. Give me the 2d8. 2d4. 2d4. 
Keith: 2d4. Five.
Austin: Hey, you got 5 back. That’s not bad. 
Ali: Ok. 
Jack (as Lem): Hey. Thanks. Thank you. 
Keith (as Fero): You’re welcome. 
Jack (as Lem): You did good with the bird. 
Keith (as Fero): Thanks. 
Jack (as Lem): You know, eventually.
Keith (as Fero): Yes, yeah. Took a few. Took 3. 
Jack (as Lem): Took 3. 
Keith (as Fero): And a song.
Jack (as Lem): And a song. 
Keith (as Fero): Sometimes things take three and a song. 
Austin (as Safewater): Three and a song.
Jack (as Lem): That’s a saying that I’ve never heard before. 
Keith (as Fero): Yep.
Jack: Wow, the bird just goes for it, doesn’t it. 
Austin: You have to understand that like…
Keith: [laughs] Yeah. 
Austin: ...for you it’s just like, [whistles], you know? It just like-
Jack: Yep. [laughs]
Keith: By the way, when I talk to the bird, it also is just like [whistles]
Austin: Yeah, yeah. Totally. Isaac’s like, 
Austin (as Isaac): This is a big boat. This sizable. What- what is this? What is this, Ordennan? What is this?
Keith (as Fero): It sleeps 8, but it’s like a sketchy 8. 
Austin (as Isaac): Is this like a- What is this? Like a- like a yacht? Like a schooner? This a sloop?
Keith (as Fero): I thought it was a sloop.
Austin (as Isaac): This seems like a sloop to me. I’m pretty sure this is a sloop. 
Keith (as Fero): I think this is a sloop, yeah. It’s not a schooner. I think we decided that it couldn't be a schooner. 
Austin (as Isaac): Definitely not a schooner. I’ve been on a schooner. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, and it’s not a pontoon, for sure. 
Austin (as Isaac): Hey, um, I don’t mean to be a weirdo. It’s like, I just think-
Keith (as Fero): Oh boy. 
Austin (as Isaac): ...it’s a beautiful moment. The four of us- five of us because there’s the bird, and you know, a boat. An adventure. And look, the moon is just so big and beautiful in the sky tonight. I’ll never forget tonight. 
Ali (as Hella): You sure won’t.
Keith (as Fero): I- Everything he says sounds like, he’s full of shit. Everything you say sounds like you’re totally full of shit. 
Austin (as Isaac): I just think I’m turnin’ a new page in life. Isaac Adelton…
Keith (as Fero): Ok. Let’s- fingers crossed that that’s true. 
Austin (as Isaac): ...Adventurer King of the Wild. 
Keith (as Fero): King?
Ali (as Hella): Let’s-
Austin (as Isaac): Adventurer King. 
Ali (as Hella): Hmm…
Keith (as Fero): Adventurer King.
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah. 
Keith (as Fero): Do you want to walk beside the boat or do you want to ride on the boat?
Austin (as Isaac): Adventurer. Isaac Adelton. New page. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah, start small, bro.
Keith (as Fero): Adventurer King sounds a lot like the old page to me. 
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah. I guess that’s true. I just got a big stomach. That’s what they say. Eyes are bigger than my stomach. That’s what they say. [Jack and Keith laugh]
Keith (as Fero): And my stomach’s- My eyes are bigger than my stomach, and my stomach’s big. 
Austin (as Isaac): And I- and I got a big stomach. 
Ali (as Hella): Isaac, word of advice? 
Austin (as Isaac): Yeah.
Ali (as Hella): You should let people believe your actions instead of your words. You feel me?
Austin (as Isaac): Ok… 
Ali (as Hella): New page. 
Austin (as Isaac): Could I diagram this one? Believe my actions,  instead of my words. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah.
Austin (as Isaac): I gotta break it to you. I hate to break it to you, but I gotta. I do illusion magic. [laughs]
Ali (as Hella): Yeah, no. Ok. 
Austin (as Isaac): My actions are-
Ali (as Hella): But you’re not an illusion. 
Keith (as Fero): Not all your ac-
Austin: [in Isaac’s voice] But Black Dynamite. [Ali and Keith laugh hard] I sell drugs to the community.
Keith: Oh boy.
Austin: I think it’s an uneventful trip back. Except for the middle of the night. Um, [exhales] Fero?
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Where do you sleep on- Or you don’t sleep? Or you- You’re on the boat? Are you on the boat? You’re on the boat. It sounds like you’re on the boat. Ok. 
Keith: I’m on the boat. I’m on the boat.
Austin: There is like, a moment when you’re alone. When is that?
Keith: Um, everyone else is asleep. 
Austin: Right, you don’t sleep, right?
Keith: And I’m- I’m on the deck. 
Austin: Yeah. Making sure everything’s alright. Making sure the boat isn’t like, crashing into anything. It’s like a calm part of the river here. You-
Keith: Yeah. Are we? We’re not like- we’re like anchored, right?
Austin: Oh, I thought you were going home. 
Keith: No, I just mean because everyone is sleeping. 
Austin: Sure, sure. I don’t know if you can handle this boat, but yeah, if everyone’s sleeping, that’s fine. You’re-
Keith: Oh, if I can handle the boat, yeah sure, I’ll drive. I can drive.
Austin: It’s like a- it’s like a- I think you probably like, ‘Hey, hit the anchor if things get- if things pick up and dock.’ You know? But like, you can handle this like, little part of the river cause you’re going down river. It’s taking you down river. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: It’s alright. 
Keith: I can’t wait to have a better driving record than Hella.
Austin: My god. 
Ali: Shut up. 
Austin: Um, you- There is the sound of someone else on this boat. You hear the sound of like, footsteps briefly. 
Keith (as Fero): Who else is on this boat?
Austin (as Samol): Shh, it is late, Fero. 
Keith (as Fero): [whispering] Who else is on this boat?
Austin: And you turn around, and Samol is there. 
Keith (as Fero): Why are you on this boat?
Austin (as Samol): I just wanted to check in before uh…. Before the night’s over. Seems like a big one.
[1:45:00]
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. It seems like a hu- like a really huge one for everybody. And for you, twice?
Austin (as Samol): Yeah. [pauses] Yeah. Yeah, it’s gonna be a big one. How’s all of the new animals and whatnot goin’?
Keith (as Fero): Good. I made a few, and there’s a few out there runnin’ around. Did you see the mushroom cats?
[crosstalk]
Austin (as Samol): The mushroom cats. Yeah, I was gonna say. Those were pretty good. 
Keith (as Fero): I know that you said stick to animals, and it’s like a fungus, but I was like- 
Austin (as Samol): Hey, mushroom cats is right on the line. It’s right on the line. I feel like-
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. Uh huh.
Austin (as Samol): You got to explore the space. 
Keith (as Fero): Uh huh. 
Austin (as Samol): So-
Keith (as Fero): Seasonal animal. No one ever did that.
Austin (as Samol): Not yet. Now they did. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Samol): Ma- next thing you know, it’s a whole new thing. A whole new trend. You settin’ a trend.
Keith (as Fero): Uh huh. How many other people out there makin’ animals? So-
Austin (as Samol): A couple. But that’s kind of it.
Keith (as Fero): Ok. 
Austin (as Samol): Look, Fero. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Samol): I just need to be straight with you on this one.
Keith (as Fero): Got it.
Austin (as Samol): Uh, tonight is it for me. 
Keith (as Fero): What do you mean?
Austin (as Samol): I gotta go do something. It’s not the moon, don’t worry about the moon. You didn’t- you didn’t- It wasn’t your fault anyway, probably. 
Keith (as Fero): No, no, no. We weren’t- That wasn’t us. It-
Austin (as Samol): So…
Keith (as Fero): It seems like our sort of thing, unfortunately. 
Austin (as Samol): It extremely seems like your sort of thing. 
Keith (as Fero): But it wasn’t us. 
Austin (as Samol): It was not. My son is very sick. And I have a way to help him. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Samol): I’m gonna take that way. But-
Keith (as Fero): What do you- What is the way?
Austin (as Samol): I’m gonna give him a little bit of what I got left. Cause I only got a little bit left. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Samol): And he’s gonna have a lot left, and he’s gonna- things are- He’s gonna help. Because that’s who he is. 
Keith (as Fero): He’s gonna help...?
Austin (as Samol): Everyone. You. Everyone. 
Keith (as Fero): Didn’t- I- we never- I haven’t met?
Austin (as Samol): You have not met him. 
Keith (as Fero): But-
Austin (as Samol): I’ve never met a smarter man.
Keith (as Fero): Ok. 
Austin (as Samol): I understand that the two of you may not have similar personalities. I ask you, as a friend of yours, Fero, respect this decision. And give him a shot. 
Keith (as Fero): Ok. 
Austin (as Samol): And don’t let him treat you like a jester. 
Keith (as Fero): Are you saying that he’s not gonna like me, and that I have to deal with it? Is that what you’re sayin’?
Austin (as Samol): I’m saying you might not like him. 
Keith (as Fero): Ok. 
Austin (as Samol): Maybe you will. I’m sayin’ it was nice. I’m glad we got to hang out. Learn some stuff. Have some- have some meals together. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. I’m still full from those.
Austin (as Samol): You’re full always. 
Keith (as Fero): I haven’t had to eat since. 
Austin (as Samol): You have any like, questions? Or… [sighs] anything like that?
Keith (as Fero): I still don’t know what I’m supposed to be doin’.
Austin (as Samol): Yeah. What are you doin’ moment to moment? You’re on this boat. Your friends are asleep. You’re lookin’ out. 
Keith (as Fero): Uh huh. 
Austin (as Samol): There’s nothing wrong with being a person who wants to look out. I don’t expect you to figure it out all at once. But I can tell you’re in a- a traveling place. You’re in a- you’re in a unsure place.
Keith (as Fero): Uh huh. 
Austin (as Samol): Are you afraid of hurting people? Is that why?
Keith (as Fero): What do you mean- what do you mean hurt?
Austin (as Samol): I don’t know. You know, uh… Between the animal stuff, but also just the like- You know, you and me, we got on like fast friends. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Samol): Even though I know the word fast in the term fast friends means like, fastened, not quick. 
Ali: Oh, does it?
Austin: It does.
Keith (as Fero): We got on like both ways. 
Austin (as Samol): Both ways. I- know you also keep people at arm’s length, and it seems like part of that is you go around this world and Nacre falls and every over thing follows you all around. And it- you know, maybe I’m wrong, but I sense that you’re a little afraid that pulling together with people puts them at threat. It puts you at threat, too. 
Keith (as Fero): Uh huh.
Austin (as Samol): I don’t know. When I think about where we’re at, everybody’s at threat anyway. I don’t have like an easy answer for you, Fero. I wish I did. I wish I could tell you the three magic words to follow- walk this way, follow this rule… That’s always more Samothes’ thing than mine though. I like feeling things out more than I like commandments. 
Keith (as Fero): If you tr- If you told me what to do, I wouldn’t have listened anyway.
Austin (as Samol): I know. That’s why I like hanging out with you. 
Keith (as Fero): It took you ten years for me to follow your one instruction. 
Austin (as Samol): Wait, what was the one instruction?
Keith (as Fero): Go- Leave. Stop hanging out with me and go. [Ali laughs]
Austin (as Samol): Yeah, it was stop hanging out with me. Get out of here. [Keith laughs] That’s right. And now I’m back. [sighs] Just do your best, and put yourself on the line and keep helpin’ people. You’ll figure it out. Or you won’t. Or you won’t. Lot of people don’t figure it out. You know? It happens. But you know, I always told my sons that it was better to try. So, I’m tellin’ you. Maybe you don’t figure it out. 
Keith (as Fero): It’s only when other people are around that there’s anything to figure out anyway. 
Austin (as Samol): That’s not true. I spent a long time alone, and I did not know what to do. It’s- It’ll catch up to you. I mean, maybe not. Maybe not. Maybe for you, you just go out in the woods and just everyday is talkin’ to birds. And maybe that’s ok. Listen, Fero. Like, if that’s where you’re at, maybe that’s ok. But for me- I have a unique perspective on things. 
Keith (as Fero): How so? [pauses before laughing]
Austin (as Samol): [laughs] Well, we’ve been over this. [Keith continues laughing]
Keith (as Fero): Oh, I remember. You were the first guy. 
Austin (as Samol): The bush and the berries and all that. 
Keith (as Fero): There was nothing before you. 
Austin (as Samol): You remember?
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah. 
Austin (as Samol): Nothing blinked, and there I was. If someone gets hurt, it’s my fault. And if someone has a good meal, it’s my fault. It all comes back to me, and so you know… I can’t imagine a world in which I have not affected the way someone’s day has gone. Which is strange because that is about to be true for everyone going forward. But only sort of because like, indirectly they still will have been affected by what I did previously. 
Keith (as Fero): Uh huh. Which was all of it.
Austin (as Samol): Everything. Yeah. Um, but-
Keith (as Fero): Like-
Austin (as Samol): You get what I’m saying?
Keith (as Fero): Uh huh. 
Austin (as Samol): And I don’t know what’s that- The thing is, I don’t know that that’s that different from other people. I don’t know. You know, even in just whatever journey you just came back from, I’m sure you affected everyone on this boat. And everyone you came in contact with. They’re day was changed by you, and I get that that’s a cause of shakiness, trouble, unexpected outcomes. But if the alternative is solitude? It’s just not the choice I would make. I feel like there’s some- you not being in someone’s life, you not being there to touch their shoulder? Heal an old wound. That absence isn’t not an action. You don’t get to wash your hands just cause you’re not in the room. Anyway, it’s gettin’ late. 
Keith (as Fero): Uh huh. 
Austin (as Samol): Moon looks real pretty. 
Keith (as Fero): For now. 
Austin (as Samol): Yeah. Good luck with everything. 
Keith (as Fero): Thanks. 
Austin (as Samol): Stay wild. 
Keith (as Fero): Uh huh. This is like, a for sure? Like 100%?
Austin (as Samol): Yeah, like 100%. Like all the percent. There’s no tricks. There’s no… loopholes. My son is dying, and I do not want him to. 
Keith (as Fero): Hm. I’ll… I’ll be nice.
Austin (as Samol): [laughs lightly] Don’t be nice. 
Keith (as Fero): I’ll be- I’ll be the- I’ll be my- my nice. Nice for me. 
Austin (as Samol): Your nice. Nice for you. 
Austin: Nice for what? [Ali and Keith laugh]
Austin (as Samol): Keep being a voice in the room to ask the questions no one else wants to or that everyone else wants to, but won’t. And if you want to be nice while doin’ it? All the better. But I don’t know. You know. You know who you care about. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Samol): Care about ‘em.
Keith (as Fero): Hey, thanks for tellin’ me not to walk towards that monster. 
Austin (as Samol): Yeah, that would have been bad. 
Keith (as Fero): That super helped. 
Austin (as Samol): Yeah. That would have- that thing would have eaten you. 
Keith (as Fero): Uh huh. I was thinkin’, should I walk towards it or away from it. And so, I was like, Samol would know. 
Austin (as Samol): Yeah.
Keith (as Fero): Ron’ll know. Ron’ll know. 
Austin (as Samol): That’s not- Don’t- Oh my god. [Keith laughs] You can’t just come up with a new name for me. I’m about-
Keith (as Fero): That’s not new. I said that before!
Austin (as Samol): Did you say Ron before? Great. 
Keith (as Fero): I said Ron before during-
Austin (as Samol): Cause it’s short for Hieron. That’s my name. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, a few times. 
Austin (as Samol): [sighs] Ok. I-
Keith (as Fero): It’s short- In some ways, Hieron is long for Ron.
Austin (as Samol): That’s true. Yeah, you got me. Do you do hugs? Is this a hug- are you good with that?
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. Yep. I do those. 
Austin: And he like, leans down and gives you a hug. 
Keith: I do the hug back in-
Austin: Hell yeah. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin (as Samol): It has been an experience, Fero Feritas. And a good one. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, it’s been good. Hey, before you go.
Austin (as Samol): Yeah. 
Keith (as Fero): Give me one- give me one idea for something, and I’ll try to- I’ll try to do it. 
Ali: Aww.
Austin (as Samol): Alright. [exhale] That’s a lot of pressure. Alright. Let me think. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. It doesn’t have to be good, remember the-?
Austin (as Samol): That’s right. It doesn’t have to be good. 
Keith (as Fero): The first thing I did?
Austin (as Samol): That’s the whole thing, it doesn’t have to be good. 
Keith (as Fero): Oh, you should have seen this thing that I tried to make that had- didn’t have enough skin. Oh boy. [Keith laughs]
Austin (as Samol): I don’t want to hear about it. That sounds terrible to me. Alright. We started with the- the squirrel. The underwater squirrels, right?
Keith (as Fero): Uh huh. Well, my first thing was the wolf with wings. 
Austin (as Samol): We didn’t start with this- Yeah, the wolf with yeah, ok. The- I’m thinkin’ there’s about to be a lot of water.
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Samol): So, like, we gotta get some sort of new water creature. And it should be friendly. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Samol): It should be like, you know how dolphins swim alongside boats, right?
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Samol): It should be like that, but it should also be-
Keith (as Fero): What if it’s… so big?
Austin (as Samol): That’s where I was going. I was gonna say bigger. [laughs] I was gonna-
Keith (as Fero): What if it’s huge?
Austin (as Samol): Yeah. Just gigantic. 
Keith (as Fero): A swimming town.
Austin (as Samol): Yeah. A town what swims. And make it purple.
Keith (as Fero): A town that swims. 
Austin (as Samol): That’s like, for me. Cause I used to fuck around with being like, a water monster. 
Keith (as Fero): Got it. 
Austin (as Samol): That was purple. 
Keith (as Fero): But this is friendly, right? Not a- not a monster town. 
Austin (as Samol): No, well… monster town’s can be alright. 
Keith (as Fero): Town for monsters, but no, it’s a town that is a monster. 
Austin (as Samol): That is a mon- No, this one is- this is a town that’s a fish. 
Keith (as Fero): Fish monster. 
Austin (as Samol): It’s like a- you know, there’s- [Keith laughs] They make schools for fish, so, I felt like maybe a big town for fish. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Samol): It’s like, a big organism that is both a bunch of little fish, but also a whole-
Keith (as Fero): Like a panther? Like a fish panther.
Austin (as Samol): Like a fish panther. Done. 
Austin: Give me- give me- give me your roll. 
Keith: Alright. 
Austin: This is a- this is an Origin of the Species, right?
Keith:This is an Origin of the Species. 
Austin: And then I’m gonna add that plus one for that item.
Keith:Yes. 
Austin: So, yeah, you can just go ahead and hit the button, and it will automatically do the plus one now.
Keith: [deep breath] Five.
Austin: Oh my god. [Ali gasps] It’s so bad. [Keith laughs]
Jack: You know, sometimes it- sometimes it goes like that. [laughs]
Keith: It’s ok. It’s ok. 
Austin: It’s just like-
Keith: I can try again. 
Austin: -a lot-
Keith: I’ll tweak it. 
Austin: Yeah, a lot of- What happens? Is it just like, a stream of regular fish- [Jack laughs] just appear and just start slapping against the boat? [Keith laughs] Just like, [foley] ‘Bah-bah-bah-bah-bah-ba-ba-ba-ba’
Keith: Everybody’s awake. Panicking.
Austin: Everyone’s awake. 
Jack: No coordination.
Austin: And panicking. Exactly, exactly. Um, and Samol-
Keith (as Fero): It’s good- No, it’s good. It’s me! It’s just me! Sorry!
Austin: And Samol in that moment says, like, 
Austin (as Samol): It doesn’t have to be good. 
Keith (as Fero): It doesn’t have to be good. It can be a bunch of stupid fish. 
Austin (as Samol): It can be a bunch of stupid fish. 
Keith (as Fero): I can tweak it. 
Austin (as Samol): Tweak it. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Samol): [laughs lightly] Have a good night, Fero. 
Keith (as Fero): Later.
Austin: Um, and I think he just like, [sighs]  I think he just like, walks to the other end of the boat, and looks out over the dock, and like, people start to come up. And it’s like one of those moments where like, Hella comes up out of the- under the cabin to turn, and like as she passes by Samol, he vanishes. You know like, he’s just not behind her anymore. 
Keith: Uh huh. 
Austin: Yeah, a bunch of fish just hit the boat. 
 [Jack de Quidt’s “Something” begins playing in the background]
Keith (as Fero): Sorry, I was trying something. 
Ali (as Hella): Uh… I’m gonna get a net for breakfast.
Keith (as Fero): Oh yeah. Get a net for breakfast. 
Austin (as Isaac): Who’s Annette? [Ali laughs]
Keith (as Fero): She’s just an old friend. She’s really good at getting fish. 
Austin: [laughing] Perfect. Good.
[Music plays out to end]
