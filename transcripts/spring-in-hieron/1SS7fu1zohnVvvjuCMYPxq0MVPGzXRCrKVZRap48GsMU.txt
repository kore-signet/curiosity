 SPRING IN HIERON 37: INGENUITY AND LOVE
Transcriber: Cole
 (recap)
Art (as Hadrian): We’re- we’re getting ready to go to down to the- to the City of First Light. I don’t know if you’re… if you’re interested maybe comin’ with us. I mean you’ll be able to go home so soon, and if you’re- if you’re down there with us, you’ll already be home. 
Austin (as Samot): Oh… Hm. 
Austin: He like, raises a hand to his mouth. 
Austin (as Samot): What are you going there for?
Art (as Hadrian): Um, I mean… [light laugh] I mean like, officially? They’ve offered all of this- this big reward for killing the Advocate, and we’re gonna go and claim it. But like, on the downlow, between me and you? Maybe we... maybe we liberate- maybe we liberate it.
Austin: He smirks,
Austin (as Samot): I’m sure… that my… [clicks tongue] I’m sure the citizens of First Light would have… already put up quite a fight, but perhaps your presence could inspire them. And nothing else then… is drawing you there?
Art (as Hadrian): I mean-
Austin (as Samot): To the city.
Art (as Hadrian): It’s im- it’s important to me… to- to one, deal with the Ordennans, and two, to… to return- to return you to your rightful place. It’s not right that you should be stuck here. 
Austin (as Samot): My rightful place…
---- 
[Jack de Quidt’s “Something” begins playing]
Austin (as Adelaide): It’s the stars. The stars have been… People- [sighs] Hella, people have been giving themselves to the stars. They’ve been convinced. They’ve been tricked. They’re raw material. The stars are using them to build something. And I think they need more. 
Austin: And then in your vision, there is a flash of lightning and a clap of thunder, and you see the whole of Hieron’s surface turn bright white. And then from that shot, the vision like, begins to move through a number of other worlds. You see Samot and Aubrey in the forge.You see his hand gripping Samothes’s hammer. Then you hear his ring- his wedding ring, hit the metal of the anvil as he runs his hand over it. And then you see him lift the hammer in his hand. And he goes to work. 
----
Austin (as Carlay): There are ways for you to take power without… a full-on revolution. Tomorrow the train will take us all to the court of Fela Malle. Within reason, you will all have whatever you wish. And if we do it right… it could be a moment of great change for Ordenna. There are ways that I can make sure that those assigned to us tomorrow are those who have been active for quite some time. 
[Jack de Quidt’s “Something” plays out to end]
Art: Ok, so… they’re gone, right? [light laugh] 
Austin: Yes. 
Art (as Hadrian): That’s a horrible idea. 
Dre (as Throndir): Which one?
Art (as Hadrian): The- We can’t just like- we can’t just let the anchor do all the work for a revolution and then just be immediately subjugated by the new person we put in charge. 
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah, no. That sucks. 
Art (as Hadrian): Alright, Just- just makin’ sure we’re all on the same page. Um, could we get Tabard through here? Could we- could Tabard claim this?
Ali (as Hella): Wait. 
Austin: [tone of ‘I don’t know’] Mm-mmm. Yeah, wait. 
Ali (as Hella): To be like, in charge?
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah.
Austin: He’s very far away and running a different culture right now.
Dre (as Throndir): He’s also- he’s very busy. 
Art (as Hadrian): But all his people are here. 
Austin: Many of them. 
Ali (as Hella): Not all of them. 
Austin: But they don’t know him. Most of them don’t know him. 
Art (as Hadrian): I don’t like our plan right now. And I don’t know how to fix it. [light laugh] 
Janine (as Adaire): I think realistically it’s very hard for us to do this unless we are willing to… take Malle’s sword away. At the very least. Even if we don’t use it against him. Um… that sucks, too. That’s a bad metaphor cause they’re people. They’re not a sword. But-
Austin: Yeah, I was confused about which sword you meant in this.
Art: Yeah, I thought you meant like, a literal sword, and I was- and I was confused I had missed an important piece of lore. 
Austin: That’s the name of his ship. [light laugh] 
Janine (as Adaire): Ok, well, look. [heavy sigh] If- if he is in charge of the anchor, which all of his followers seem to be super- super keen on him having that power- if he doesn’t have that power, our odds are a million times better. Um, if he doesn’t have that power, the odds are a million times better that the people around him will also decide they’re slightly indifferent to him all of a sudden or something like that. Like, it opens the door. Um… again, I’m not saying… [sighs] the thing to do is take full advantage, but… taking… [sighs] depriving him of a large portion of what has kept him in control isn’t a bad idea. 
Art (as Hadrian): Sure, but then what?
Ali (as Hella): [heavy sigh] Then they do whatever the fuck they want. 
[crosstalking]
Art (as Hadrian): No, we can’t just-
Ali (as Hella): I don’t wanna like-
Janine (as Adaire): We have to deal with ‘then what?’ either way. There’s no situation where there’s no ‘then what?’ other than us getting a bunch of money and a nice house and Hella gets her family name back, and then maybe I ask for like, another cool sword and then we go. Like… we need- [sighs] It’s- it’s going somewhere either way. 
Art (as Hadrian): We need to fix this. 
Janine (as Adaire): Totally. 
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah. 
Art (as Hadrian): Ok. Then everyone say what you think fixing this means, just so I’m sure we’re all on the same page. [Austin and Ali laugh] 
[Ali/Hella and Dre/Throndir sigh heavily] 
Janine (as Adaire): We don’t know enough people here is part of it. If we had a good idea of who was living here before, what the leadership structure here immediately before Ordenna came… 
Ali (as Hella): Uh- part one, we ask for all the shit that we want. Part two, maybe we kill that guy. I don’t care. Part three, we make sure that he can’t have that army anymore, and then they can do whatever they want. They can do whatever they want. Um…
Dre (as Throndir): How do they make plates?
Ali (as Hella): There’s like, a whole blood thing. I- I- If you want to research the one that I have, but I don’t think it works anymore. 
Dre (as Throndir): Mm. 
Art (as Hadrian): But they’re just gonna do it again. Whoever we put in is just gonna make more anchor. 
Dre (as Throndir): That’s what I’m saying, do we- can we break the thing that makes plates?
Ali (as Hella): Ohhhh. I- I thought we would re- lead this revolt, and then the anchor would kind of decide what they want to do. But yeah, you have a good point. That they-
Dre (as Throndir): Well, yeah. They can’t decide what they want to do if there’s plates around. [light laugh] 
Austin: Those plates don’t work after ten years. 
Dre: Oh, that’s right. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Austin: Like those- They are free. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: They are- they are not-
Art (as Hadrian): But the- the rest of them can’t. The under- the under-tens, and the ones that they’ll just keep making can’t. And they’ll just start killing them at nine years, three hundred and sixty-four days-
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah. 
Art: -or however long a Hieron year is. 
Janine (as Adaire): I mean, you know, once we- once we have the keys to the kingdom, it’s not like we have to leave immediately. Like, we can figure out how stuff gets made, put a wrench in the thingy, and then… it doesn’t- it’s broken. [laughs] Like, but we don’t know what the thingy is yet, so… you know?
Art (as Hadrian): I worry we’ll get killed tryin’ to figure it out. That- The new leadership is not gonna be interested in giving up the anchor. 
Ali (as Hella): Well, we’ll be part of the new leadership. That’s the whole point. 
Janine (as Adaire): I mean we also don’t have to promote new leadership until we figure that part out… right?
Art (as Hadrian): Well, I mean it’s gonna be… it’s gonna be the person we’re conspiring with. That’s how-
[crosstalking] 
Janine (as Adaire): I mean we didn’t discuss with them at all. 
Art (as Hadrian): That’s how conspiracies work. I- I just think that-
Janine (as Adaire): I don’t know that-
Art (as Hadrian): -that’s what they walked away from this probably thinking.  
Janine (as Adaire): Maybe, but not everyone would… want that shit. 
Dre (as Throndir): What if we destroy the forge?
Ali (as Hella): The god forge? [Ali and Janine laugh] 
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah?
Ali (as Hella): [sucks teeth] Uhhhh. [sighs] I guess we could. 
Dre (as Throndir): I mean, yeah. This is-
Janine (as Adaire): Probably shit you can do to mess up a god forge. 
Dre (as Throndir): This is the same conversation we had about the you know… god dragon, and that went pretty good. 
Ali (as Hella): [stammering] The- You- The god dragon was… [laughs] had lightning. It was fighting us. The forge is just sitting there. 
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah, no. 
Ali (as Hella): Which makes it easier to destroy. 
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah. [louder] Yeah, see. 
Ali (as Hella): I- you know, but I just you know. [Austin laughs] Should be in a museum [quietly] or something. I don’t know. 
Art (as Hadrian): But I don’t know that we can stab it. 
Dre (as Throndir): Sure.
Janine: What was that sword dream about? Could we stab it with that dream sword? Was that relevant?
Austin: Wait, did Hella explain the dream sword?
Janine: I don’t know. That’s what I’m asking. 
Austin: I didn’t know if that was in char- I thought you were asking in character. [Ali laughs] 
Janine: I- No. I...I want to know- I want to know if we have any ideas of where the sword fits in here. 
Ali: Um, I think Hella told at least Adaire about the dream sword, but I think that she also maybe gathered everyone around it cause she was like, ‘Hey, Hadrian, I know you also about- a lot about swords. And I want Adaire here, so Throndir should also be in the conversation.’ [Dre snorts a laugh] 
Ali (as Hella): I had this weird dream about a sword-
Austin: I’m sorry, Throndir. [Ali laughs] 
Dre: No, that’s fine. 
[crosstalking]
Ali: [laughing hard] I’m so sorry, Throndir.
Dre: Hey, I’m just happy to be thought of. [Austin and Janine laugh] 
Ali: It’s my girlfriend and the sword expert, I’m sorry. [Dre laughs]
Austin: [quietly] Uh huh. 
Dre: Yeah, no. It’s fair. 
Ali: But yeah, I don’t know. It’s probably the night that that happens which is like, 
Ali (as Hella): I reached out to Adelaide to- to try to see what the fuck that we do, and the only thing I got was this weird sword, so it seems important. Um… [sighs] Yeah, I think it’s still in that forge. I don’t know. That dude Samot made it. [sighs] He seemed bummed. I don’t know. [laughs] 
Art (as Hadrian): That dude, Samot. [Austin and Ali laugh] 
Austin: [laughing] In that forge. 
Art (as Hadrian): The guy who like, lives with us now? [Austin laughs hard]
Janine (as Adaire): I didn’t know he made- well, I guess he paints. 
Art (as Hadrian): You… you’ve met him.
Ali (as Hella): I haven’t met- Have I...
Art (as Hadrian): [over Hella]I You spent time with him. 
Ali (as Hella): I haven’t spent that much time with him. 
Art (as Hadrian): [over Hella] Didn’t the four of us have dinner once?
Austin: He was probably at dinner once, at least. 
Ali (as Hella): [heavy sigh] We don’t really talk. He killed me! Did you forget that? [pauses] Well, he didn’t kill me. 
Austin: [quietly] Wait, did he?
Ali (as Hella): He just thought that I could be killed.
Austin: Yeah. [Ali laughs] 
Art (as Hadrian): That’s not the same. 
Ali (as Hella): Well, he-
Art (as Hadrian): Doubting the immortality of Hella Varal is not the same as murder. 
Ali (as Hella): But… he certainly didn’t try to not have me killed. 
Janine (as Adaire): Yeah, he like, scrobbled you to death. 
Ali (as Hella): Mhm.
Austin: [incredulous shouting] We- Ok. We! [Ali laughs] Hadrian said ‘jabroni’ like twenty minutes ago. [Janine laughs] We cannot add ‘scrobble’ to the dictionary. [Ali’s laugh grows higher and harder] [someone claps]
Dre: What is… what is scrobbled?
Austin: Oh my god. I don’t even think it’s the right word!
Janine: Scrobbling is when you like, go back and forth in a- in a digital audio track. 
Dre: Oh yeah. 
Ali: You know when they scrobble in all that stop-motion pattern magic? [laughs] 
Austin: [groans disapproval] Uh, you know… [Ali laughs] There are- you know! You got me. [Janine laughs] 
Ali: I did it! 
Austin: Fuck. [Ali laughs hard] Anyway.
Ali: Anyway. 
Dre: You know when Morbash would chop and screw pattern magic? [Austin and Ali laugh] 
Austin: Morbash fuckin’ would. Morbash from Houstin. You don’t even know. [everyone laughs; Dre laughs hard] Morbash out here like, ‘H-Town’! Um- [snorts a laugh] god. If anyone draws Morbash sippin’ Lean, I’m gonna be furious. [everyone laughs]
Dre: [groans] Ugh.
Ali: God. 
Ali (as Hella): Anyway, no. I- I asked specifically like, what am I gonna do about this whole Marielda to make this work. Cause this is… it’s a lot. It’s a lot. And all I got back was like, the sword, and there was some lightning. Um… [tongue click] And I think it’s in a forge…. [excitedly] In the god forge!
Dre (as Throndir): Ah. 
Ali (as Hella): It’s in the god forge!
Dre (as Throndir): Alright, so we’re two for two now on the forge thing. 
Ali (as Hella): [deep inhale and exhale] Yeah, sounds like it. 
Janine (as Adaire): It’s just on the floor? Like, no one’s moved it?
Ali (as Hella): Ye- I- You know, I had a vision. I don’t know what to tell you. [light laugh] 
Janine (as Adaire): Ok... 
Ali (as Hella): [quietly] I’m sorry.
Dre (as Throndir): I mean we could just go. 
[crosstalking]
Ali (as Hella): Yeah, I mean-
Dre (as Throndir): Like, we can just go now.
Art (as Hadrian): I mean you can ask for the sword.
Ali (as Hella): Two birds. 
Janine (as Adaire): No, I think… Oh, we should ask for the sword.
Art (as Hadrian): If it’s really that sword…
Janine (as Adaire): We have a lot of wishes. 
Art (as Hadrian): …I- I’d take that. 
Ali (as Hella): Well, do we want them to know that there’s a sword on the floor of somewhere that’s-?
Austin: [over Ali] Hadrian? I need you to do me a favor. Can you just roll me 2d6 straight?
Art: Uh, yeah. I’m gonna roll it as dexterity cause it’s easier. 
Austin: That’s fine. 
Art: My dexterity modifier is zero. 
Austin: It’s- You- It’s as if there is one less link on the cloak. It’s as if it got tighter. 
Art: It’s like, choking me.
Austin: It’s not choking you. It’s just-
Art: Ok. 
Austin: You feel… And it doesn’t- there isn’t one less. You count them. You can count them. There isn’t one less. But for a moment, that is what it feels like. 
Dre: And that’s what you get for tryin’ to be greedy about swords. 
Janine: It’s very rude for someone to choke you with a [laughs]  fuckin’... 
Dre (as Throndir): I mean do we even wait for tomorrow to do this? Like, we could… go steal that ship. We could go tonight. 
Art (as Hadrian): I mean they could just give a- If they give us the sword, it doesn’t… They could give it to us on- Like, they don’t know. And they don’t care. 
Dre (as Throndir): I really don’t know if I trust them to actually give us anything of like… significant value tomorrow that’s not monetary value. 
Art (as Hadrian): It’s historic value. It’s a- it’s a priceless relic of my faith. 
Janine (as Adaire): Also, are we saying Ordenna is straight up dishonorable now and not just horrible?
Ali (as Hella): I mean there’s potential that they’re also dishonorable. [Janine, Austin, and Ali laugh]
Janine (as Adaire): I just wondered if that’s- if we’re dealing with that- if we’re dealing with a case where we are expecting duplicity, even in an award ceremony-
Dre (as Throndir): I mean have you...
Janine (as Adaire): -that’s a good thing to know going into. 
Dre (as Throndir): I’m kind of surprised you haven’t been?
Janine (as Adaire): Well… [sighs] You know, it’s… An award ceremony just seems like a thing. Like, it just seems like a thing where you ask for the thing, and they say they’re gonna give you the thing, and then they do. 
[0:15:00]
Austin: I- I would have ticked a box at this point if you had reason to believe that. You’ve rolled successfully with regards to Carlay, who is someone who would know if they were gonna fuck you over. Carlay’s framing of this has been that Ordenna wants your success to be part of their success. And so that is like… You do not need to worry. They might not agree of what you ask for, but this is not a secret trap to kill four people who they believe they could kill whenever they wanted to because they’re Ordenna, ya know?
Art: I mean why wouldn’t they have done it twenty minutes ago?
Austin: Right. Right. You’ve been in this one building this whole time. They have- they have bombs that almost killed Samot. 
Janine: They could have exploded our boat. 
Austin: Yes. Yes. 
Janine: Like, they could have-
Austin: There’s a billion ways they could have killed you by now.
Janine (as Adaire): And Carlay said anything within reason. Maybe they don’t fuckin’ know. 
Art (as Hadrian): A sword they’re not using and don’t care about, which they don’t because they don’t believe in any of this junk is… 
Art: Hold on. Hadrian didn’t say ‘junk.’ Um- [Austin, Art, and Ali laugh] 
Janine: No?
Art (as Hadrian): Stuff they don’t believe in cause they don’t share the faith. They don’t- I- I think it’s garbage to them. 
Janine (as Adaire): [over Hadrian] Yeah, they don’t believe in any of this junk. 
Art: Thank you. [Austin laughs hard] 
Ali: [laughing hard] Thank you. 
Art (as Hadrian): Unless it’s the greatest sword ever forged. And maybe. But like, they’re not gonna think that. I don’t see why they wouldn’t give it to us. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. I mean what are we asking for here? We’re asking for me to get my family name back, I guess. Hadrian is asking for a sword. Throndir um… are… You ask for a tour of the forge?
Dre (as Throndir): Oh. 
Janine (as Adaire): Oooo. 
Ali (as Hella): And Adaire, uh, wild card. Which is what you’re known for. 
Janine (as Adaire): [light laugh] Mm.
Dre (as Throndir): I wanna get something cool out of this though. [Ali and Austin laugh] 
Art (as Hadrian): I think we also are still gonna get money. I think it’s gonna be money and a thing. 
Austin: That is what-
Janine (as Adaire): You can probably take that guy’s hat or something once we get rid of him. Like… you know. I don’t think they’re gonna check our pockets on the way out. 
Dre (as Throndir): This is also the birthplace of like, you know… guns. So, there’s probably something here that I could-
Austin: You could get a sick Golden Lance gun. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Ali (as Hella): This is where guns were born?
Art (as Hadrian): Or like a baby gun from the gun nursery. [Dre laughs] 
Ali (as Hella): What? [laughs]
Art (as Hadrian): Cause guns are born here. A nursery is where you put things that were just… [Ali/Hella sighs heavily] It’s a very funny joke, Hella. [Austin laughs] 
Ali (as Hella): Mmm. [Dre laughs] 
Janine (as Adaire): Maybe that’s what you ask for Throndir is like, a custom gun forged in the forge, but you like-
Dre (as Throndir): Oh yeah, I wanna like- Yeah, ok. 
Janine (as Adaire): You like- you like ask them- You know, it’s like the Bite Lipstick bar. You know- you don't know. 
Austin: Hm. [laughs] [Janine laughs] 
[crosstalking]
Janine: You like, make an appointment and-
Dre: Wait, is that Throndir doesn’t know or I, Andrew, don’t know? [laughs] 
Janine: [amused] Throndir doesn’t know about Bite Lipstick. 
Janine (as Adaire): Um, you like, it’s like a place, and you go and you make an appointment, and they like, have a color consultant or whatever who helps you make a custom lipstick. And they like, mix it in front of you and stuff like that. It’s like that, but for a gun in a god forge. That’d be fun. That’s like a tour, also a gun. 
Art: So, this lipstick exists in universe now? [Art, Janine, and Austin laugh]
Austin: Uh huh. We got a sponsorship. Thanks to-
Janine: Adaire invented the Bite- the Bite Lip Bar, Lip Lab in- in DuCarte’s. 
Austin: And I believe-
Janine: It was a thing that they did there. 
Ali: Ooo. 
Austin: I believe we are contractually obligated to also say that did you know, Friends at the Table is available on Pandora. [Austin, Janine, and Ali laugh] 
Art: Try Pandora lipstick… 
Janine: Doesn’t exist. 
Art: It’s like lipstick you have, but with ads put on it. [Austin laughs] 
Janine: Great. 
Janine (as Adaire): I don’t wanna waste the last question. I guess we could just- No, they probably wouldn’t… I think just asking for that big boat would be beyond the realm of- I think that’d be pushing it. 
Dre (as Throndir): Eh. Ehh. 
Janine (as Adaire): That’s like their brand new boat. They only have one. 
Dre (as Throndir): Eh. Yeah, but if their whole thing is that they want to take credit for what we did, like what better way of doing that-
Janine (as Adaire): That’s true. 
Dre (as Throndir): -than like, sending us in a giant like, gleaming sign of how incredible their technology is? 
Dre: I’m gonna go brush my teeth after saying that. [Austin laughs]
Art (as Hadrian): [laughing] Wh- what says we’re taking credit for these people than giving them our most expensive boat? [Janine laughs]
Dre (as Throndir): No, cause it’s like you know, we’re like, sailing around in their boat, and then people have to ask, well, where’d you get it from?’ And we’ll be like, ‘Oh, it’s Ordenna and-’ [Austin and Janine laugh]
Art (as Hadrian): So they- they built that boat for the exposure. 
Dre (as Throndir): I’m-
Janine (as Adaire): Yeah, they- they built it just for influencers to use. 
Dre (as Throndir): I don’t know. You’re asking me to think like an asshole, and like, I’m a lot of things, but I don’t think I’m that kind of asshole. 
Art (as Hadrian): I don’t think they’re gonna give us the boat. I’m not- I don’t- Your thought process, sound as it may be, it’s like-
Austin: [interjecting] Can I-
Art (as Hadrian): -if someone did something for the university, we’re not gonna give them Hella. [Austin laughs lightly]
Janine (as Adaire): [small laugh] A boat’s not a person. 
Janine: Yeah?
Austin: Speaking of boats, we should get off this boat. I’m begging us to get off this boat. [Ali laughs] 
Dre: Yeah. Ok.
Austin: I promise it’s gonna be ok. [Ali laughs] 
Janine: But I [quietly] don’t want to waste my question…
Dre: Is-
Austin: I know. And I’m gonna- 
Janine: [resigned] Ok.
Austin: I’m telling you it’s gonna be ok. 
Janine: Alright. 
Dre (as Throndir): Alright. Is there anything I should go check out while you all sleep?
Austin: Also, wait. No- There’s not like, you get one question. [Austin and Ali laugh] 
Janine: No, I mean the…[overlapped] wish- 
Austin: It’s not a genie. 
Janine: -or whatever. [laughs] 
Austin: It’s… [Janine laughs hard]
Janine: Literally- You literally said he’s- you can ask him for one thing, and he’ll give you it. 
Austin: I know, but you are framing-
Janine: Like, that’s basically a genie. 
Austin: Ok. It’s- I’m- You can- It’s a conversation. It’s a negotiation. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Dre: Janine’s got a golden ticket, and she doesn’t want to end up-
Austin: I get it. 
Dre: -dying next to an Oompa Loompa. 
Austin: So, I think- Is it just like, this sort of conversation into the night until finally everyone gets some sleep? Are there nerves?
Janine: Yeah. I guess Heist still doesn’t- I’m never gonna use Heist. It’s such a good move.
Austin: You could use Heist when you get there. You can definitely ask me those questions once you get the lay of the land. 
Janine: [sighs] Yeah. 
Art: Oh, just before we get goin’-
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: I wanna talk about the move I took. 
Austin: [resigned sigh] Ok. You don’t want to just tell me that when we use it?
Art: Well, I- I want to give you a chance. 
Austin: Ok. [laughs] Ok. 
Art: I got to choose a third thing that makes me burn with righteous anger. 
Austin: Yes, ok. 
Art: Which is wanton cruelty and unnecessary suffering. 
Austin: And what is the first one- first two?
Art: My other two are cowardice, treachery and selfishness and threats to my loved ones. 
Austin: Who is your ward?
Art: I have not declared one. 
Austin: Would you like to?
Art: Um.. how’s everyone feelin’?
Ali: I have four debilities…
Art: I think it’s Hella. [Ali laughs] 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: [laughs] Ok. Alright. Sounds good. 
Art: Hella Varal. 
Austin: Ok. So-
Art: I don’t know, maybe there’s a lot of Hella’s here. May be a common name. 
Austin: Oh my god. Eh, you never know. It’s Ordenna. Um, you… wake up the next morning. There is some early-early morning you know, traffic outside. There’s people walkin’ around, gettin’ marketplaces set up. There’s you know, the sound of uh… of some like, bells and horns and stuff near the shoreline. And there’s the sound of trains running automatically um, from all over the city. Which are remarkable to look at. You’ve read about them or have heard about them from Samol, but like, seeing trains running is wild. Seeing them change tracks, seeing the tracks change. There’s a lot of weird technology here that is- it’s still- it’s Marielda. Like, it didn’t stop being Marielda. It’s dirtier than what we imagined before. It’s grimier. It’s sootier. But it is still that stuff, and so that is like, pretty weird to look at. And Carlay shows up to lead you with uh- [light laugh] by the way, with six anchor to the train station. Does anyone need to do any like, exercise in the morning? Is there any rolls we need to do before we get on this train?
Art: I mean I would take like, just a moment to imagine in like, the cafe on the corner eating like, a quick breakfast and coffee. 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. 
Art: But like, we don’t have to do that scene. 
Austin: That’s- that’s probably what you get. You get a nice- It’s- it’s probably the cafe  downstairs in the same building. Cause it’s still protected by those guards.
Art: Oh, right. Bed and Breakfast, yeah. 
Austin: Yeah, it’s a Bed and Breakfast. There’s the breakfast part. It’s great. They have those- this room has those like, big, big, big fans. Do you know what I’m talkin’ about? Those giant ceiling fans that move real slow? Like... you can like, see the um- [clicks tongue] 
Janine: Do you just mean a ceiling fan that’s on low?
Austin: It is, but it’s like bigger. Like, the blades are really wide, and you can see the um… the like, system of pulleys that’s working it. It’s not just a ceiling fan that plugs just into the wall. It plugs into a system of pulleys that you can see around like, the roof of this floor- the ceiling of this floor. You know, you’ve- I’m recalling particular memories, I, Austin Walker, have had and cannot tell you when or where this was, but I’m imagining specific fans I’ve seen in my life. [light laugh] They’re cool. 
Um, and yeah. You’re lead to this kind of train pickup place, and it is like, an imperial train. There is only two cars. There’s like the engine and then the kind of like, guest carriage- or like the main carriage. And it’s you, six anchor, and Carlay. And I think that that’s it. And you’re- you begin to lift up, you know, on track over the river headed east towards the iron wall of what was once Samothes’s home. Any final like, notes here before we enter? [silence] Ok. So… I have to get some fuckin’ notes up real quick. Um, you pull into a- like, as you- as the train approaches, one of these apertures opens in the side of the wall- And again, it just- I have to underscore how weird it feels to be on what’s like- it feels like I guess like, the interior of a boat, but a boat that’s on tracks, ya know? It’s like a room that’s moving. It’s weird. And it leads you into a reception hall. There are… I have to like, do a double- a double-dip of like- I have to think not only of how things have changed over the last… many, many, many centuries, but also how Malle would have changed them since then. 
And so what I think is here is like, [sighs] as you step off of the train and into the reception hall, first of all, everything is in Ordennan color. Second of all, everything is um… [click tongue] There is a space where there was once a receiving hall where there were- I think there probably still are five high thrones, but those thrones have just been covered with canvas so that you can’t see them. But Hadrian, you definitely feel the presence of the gods here. It is a big, like, huge room. The ground is black marble. There are columns here that have kind of um… inscriptions that are new. New like, inscriptions of Ordennan like, conquests that have been added. And it’s like a lot of- [sighs] It’s like, gaudy. It’s a lot of like, them trying to make their mark felt in a space that has such history and has been like, so storied and has stuff from such a long time ago that it’s actually hard for them to do it. It’s like putting whipped cream on top of something- like, it’s like putting whipped cream on top of a steak. It’s still a fuckin’ steak under there, ya know? [light laugh] All you’ve done is ruin it. All you’ve done is ruined what was already there. You haven’t crafted something that really speaks to your particular like, aesthetic or anything like that. And-
Art: You know what might be fun?
Austin: What’s that?
Art: What here is evil?
Austin: In this moment, you get a very weird answer to this. Um, so certainly, the Ordennans, right? …[sighs] Maybe not Carlay. Probably not Carlay. Mmm... [click tongue] [exhales ‘kwooo’] We’ve never had this totally misfire, right?
Art: No, it’s- it’s like, not a- [stammering] It’s- it’s…
Austin: I know it’s not a roll, but I mean like, we’ve had moments where it’s like, ‘oh, different people say different things,’ right?
Art: Yeah, but we never had it just- We’ve never had it come up with just- It’s never come back like, blank, you know? And I don’t know how that would feel. I don’t know what it feels like when it’s nothing. I don’t know what it feels like when it’s-
Austin: It’s not nothing… It is.... Hadrian, I think for a moment you think it’s telling you that you are. It makes you feel like, ‘Oh, I am evil,’ but then there’s a second beat. And maybe in this passing moment, you realize what’s being felt is that the person telling you what is evil is pointing inwards at himself. 
Art: [groans] Oof.
Austin: There is a sudden and great feeling of… dissatisfaction with- with the self. And again, I don’t know that it’s- it’s so in you that it’s hard to separate Samot from you, in this brief moment. 
Art: Well, that’s not the fun answer I was looking for. It was gonna be a commentary on architecture, but um… [Ali laughs lightly]
Austin: Right, sure. No.
Art: I’m suitably terrified. 
Austin: Uh huh. You are brought into- So, immediately as you’re like, moved through this main reception hall, you note that there’s like, a lot of people around, actually, and that this place has not- This place, you know, eons ago was a space that yes, people came to visit for certain things, you know, like, ‘Oh yes, there’s a- it’s um, High Sun Day, and so that is a day where like, the other gods show up. The other Samtheon members show up, and people have a big party. And there’s guests.’ But by and large, it was a very- it was a very solitary estate, right? It was like, Samothes and Primo, and that was kind of it. You know, maybe a couple of other attendants and some pala-din. Not the case here. 
This place is like- has been turned into something with a factory vibe. People are running around with materials. People are pushing things around on- in- on like, carts. There are people who are discussing things as they move through the hallways. Despite half of this volcano being kind of carved away and replaced with a wall, there is- somehow it feels like the space is being used more efficiently inside. 
[0:30:00]
Which is to say, it’s being used. Eventually though, Carlay manages to wave down someone, and they’re like, 
[0:30:00]
Austin (as Attendant): Of course, of course, of course. 
Austin: And then they lead you into- through a pair of gigantic doors and into what is like, the real like, reception hall. The throne room. Which is a big room that has two rows of- er two long tables and then the throne at the front. At the end of the- er at the end of the room. And the floor of this entire room is made of glass. And as you look down, you know, if you do choose to look down through the glass, you see the interior of the volcano below. Which is so far below at this point, that there is just kind of a- or maybe it’s something where the glass is treated- or the way it refracts light, but it is like, a soft, red glow in this room. And this room has other lighting, so it doesn’t overwhelm, but like, looking straight down does produce this red-orange glow. 
Um, and everyone, as you step into this room, rises from their chairs at these tables where there was just kind of like, a rolling conversation previously. Except for Fela Malle who is in the big throne at the end of the- at the end of the room. And he remains seated and kind of slouched. And the- everybody else who’s raised- who has stood up begins to clap as you enter the room. I’d say there’s probably a hundred people here- fifty on each side. Again, imagine this room as kind of a square or a rectangle with one- with one table to the north and one table to the south. Like, long, long banquet tables, and people sitting side by side at each. And they have all raised to like, applaud as you enter the room. And uh, I think Carlay takes one step to the side and begins to raise their voice and says, 
Austin (as Carlay): Now presenting the heroes of the so-called Last University! Hadrian, the Dragon Slayer, Paladin of Samothes. Throndir, Ranger of the Golden Lance. Hella Varal… Qu… Hella Varal. [Ali laughs] Daughter of Ordenna. And Adaire Ducarte, Mapmaker. 
Austin: Everyone like, ‘oh~’ [claps and makes muffled sounds of approval] 
Austin (as Crowd): [clapping] Ordenna!
Austin: And Fela Malle like, leans over and whispers something to one of his attendants, and then they say, 
Austin (as Malle’s Attendant): You may approach!
Art: I’d just like to make a brief note that this is a surprisingly emotional moment for Hadrian. I’ve always uh… I’ve always imagined that the Undying Fire referred to in the title- Defending- er Defender of the Undying Fire refers to this volcano. 
Austin: Mm. 
Art: And so like, being in it and seeing the literal fire is like, a-
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: -a bittersweet moment [Ali sighs an ‘aww’] because as we’ve discussed and um, I’m not sure any of those titles mean anything anymore. 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah, what are they? What are- what are all of them? Let’s go through them real quick. 
Art: Sword of Samothes. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Art: Most likely to still be true. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: Literally true. 
Austin: Literally true. 
Art: Yeah. Um, Defender of the Undying Fire.
Austin: Uh huh. 
Art: Seems less relevant. The… I mean it might not have ever been relevant, if you really think about it, [Austin laughs] but the- the church that- that ascribed relevance to it is gone. 
Austin: Yeah.
Art: And then um, Officer of the Order of Eternal Princes, which I guess I have to talk to Ephrim about.
Austin: Yeah, y’all should work out what that is at this point. 
Art: But it might just be us, in which case, an off- I want a better title than officer. I want to be vice president or better. 
Janine: Senior officer. [Austin laughs] 
Ali: Mm.
Austin: Chief Executive of the Order of [laughing] Eternal Princes. 
Dre: Branch Manager. 
Austin: [laughs] Alright. Uh, do you approach?
Dre: Yeah, sure. 
Art: Yeah, uh huh. That’s what we’re here for. 
Austin: Ok. Um, you approach. I think the kind of like, phalanx of anchor walks behind you carrying, at this point, like, carrying some sort of banners that Carlay has given them. And like, they stand in formation behind the four of you. Um, and as you approach, the attendant- Fela Malle’s attendant says, 
Austin (as Malle’s Attendant): Lord Imperator Malle wishes you all-
Austin: Not ‘wishes you all,’ Um, what is the word I’m looking for? 
Austin (as Malle’s Attendant): Lord Atten-
Austin: Not ‘Lord Attendant.’
Austin (as Malle’s Attendant): Lord Imper-
Austin: I keep wanting to say Imperator [im-pa-raah-ter] because that’s the name of the new Paradox game, but that’s not right. 
Austin (as Malle’s Attendant): Lord Imperator Malle welcomes you to Ordenna’s home in Hieron. And congratulates you on a successful hunt. You have done us all a great service. In honor of your victory, you will be offered one hundred thousand gold in Ordennan currency or… a beautiful estate across the river in the northern expanse of Ordennan’s territory along with the official title, Hadrian, Defender of Civilization, Sword of Humanity, Slayer of the Dragon of Death. 
Ali (as Hella): Wait. Um, I’m so- I’m sorry. That dragon didn’t have anything to do with Death. 
Austin (as Malle’s Attendant): But [stammers] it killed- it killed a lot of people. 
Ali (as Hella): But she didn’t… [sighs and laughs] You can say like, the dragon of the fire.
Art (as Hadrian): I think it’s low- I think it’s lowercase ‘d’.
Austin (as Malle’s Attendant): Lowercase ‘d’. Just a general-
Ali (as Hella): Ok, you can just- [laughs] Thank you.
Art (as Hadrian): Uh, I’m honored. I- I humbly accept. Thank you. 
Austin (as Malle’s Attendant): Whi- which one?
Art (as Hadrian): I have to pick one?
Austin (as Malle’s Attendant): The money or… 
Janine (as Adaire): Should we have looked into the estate?
Austin (as Malle’s Attendant): The money or the estate. 
Janine (as Adaire): What if it was like, cool?
Art (as Hadrian): I- I can’t move my family. I’ll take the money. 
Austin (as Malle’s Attendant): Congratulations. The gracious Lord Malle would also be willing to condescend and hear any other requests you have of the great Ordennan Impetus. 
Art (as Hadrian): [under breath] Oh, I was hoping Hella would go first. My request seems so much more reasonable compared to hers. [returning to regular voice] Um, it is my understanding that you are in possession of a historic religious artifact significant to my faith and the faith of the northern peoples, and it would- it would be… my great honor to be able to return it to the Last University. 
Austin: The cloak tightens again. 
Art: Yeah, well, he’s-
Austin: Malle um- Malle says, kind of like, sitting up in his throne. It’s a simple throne. It’s like a simple throne comprised of- like, I don’t want to say cinder block, but it- it is like, built of brick. It is built of like, mason work. And it has like, padding on it for where he’s seated, and like, the pads have a kind of like, tossed on gold frame. But it is- it is like- It is like, the equivalent of building a chair out of like, cartons or something. You know? It is not… a beautiful like, ornate thing, and I don’t know that you necessarily know what’s up with these things. But- but I guess, maybe he illustrates his point a little bit because he says, 
Austin (as Fela Malle): The relics of your faith have been destroyed. 
Art (as Hadrian): I’m not sure all of them. We have reason to believe this one still exists. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): You have reason. Tell me your reason, Hadrian. 
Art (as Hadrian): I mean you’re not gonna like the answer cause it involves stuff you don’t believe in. But we… uh, you know, we have it on a divine authority that- that there is… that there is a blade of historic significance in the forge. And if you- if you say it’s destroyed, then my- my request is to go look for it. I’d love to look around the forge. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): It is rare that anyone has anything on divine authority these days. We’ve done our best to stomp that out. Describe the blade for me. What’s it look like?
Art (as Hadrian): Well, I mean… It looks a lot like the one I’m carrying. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): Draw it.
Art: He does. 
Austin: And he draws the blade he’s wearing. And it is his blade. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): This one? A relic of faith? I thought it was just very sharp. 
Art (as Hadrian): No. It’s- it’s… terribly important. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): Normally, in a negotiation, you downplay the value of the thing you want, Hadrian. I’ll give you the blade, if you carry my title. Blade of Malle. 
Art (as Hadrian): I- I’ll carry that title as long as I carry the sword. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): Good. 
Austin: And he like, reaches down- and he’s a big man. He’s like… he’s like, Hella big. He’s like, maybe even a little bit bigger than Hella. He’s no Red Jack, but he’s big. He has on like, a uh… It is like, a thin coat? It’s like a- it’s literally a see-through coat. Like, it is- it is black and um, translucent. But that- and that coat has like, white fur around the edges. It’s a very weird look, but under that, he has on like- he is wearing armor. And it makes him look like he has like, a long-
Janine: [interjecting] I’m picturing fantasy Ric Flair.
Austin: Yeah. Yeah, uh huh. 
Janine: Ok. 
Austin: What if it Ric Flair had on platemail? 
Janine: Ok. 
Austin: And also had on his- one of his robes. Yeah. But also, his face is not that. I’ve described his face um- I’ve described his face as I describe most faces, which is in relation to Gundam or Fire Emblem characters. Uh, he has a face sort of like Rakan Dahkaran’s face. R-A-K-A-N D-A-H-K-A-R-A-N. Or… the um… god, what is the name of the Fire Emblem character? [typing] Uh, the king- I think it’s Ashnard? It’s a bad name. But it is. It’s Ashnard. [laughs]
Janine: That’s a really bad name if you live in a volcano. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: Mm. [laughs] 
Austin: It ain’t great. Actually, wow, this new version of him- This new version of Ashnard that is from the mobile game is- might be the dude. One second. Let me post this in chat. 
Art: I don’t wanna snatch victory out of the jaw- snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory here, but you realize I’m lying to him, right?
Austin: Yeah, what? 
Art: Ok.
Austin: I mean you want this sword, right?
[crosstalking]
Art: I want this sword. I don’t plan to carry it, so like the agreement to carry to title- Ok. 
Austin: Yeah, I understand that you have a loop- loophole here, but I’m not- Yeah. 
Ali: Aren’t we killing this guy? Who cares?
Austin: Pro- He throws the- he throws the sheath and then the sword separately onto the ground in between you and him. I’d say he’s probably about forty feet away from you, so he just kind of like, throws it, and then it slides across the glass. Each one separately. 
Art: Fuckin’ dangerous. 
Austin: It’s not a gun. [light laugh] 
Art: I mean it could hit someone. 
Austin: It’s a- it’s the empty floor. He’s very accomplished. [light laugh] 
Art: I wouldn’t do it. 
Janine: If he wanted to throw a sword at someone, they would know. [light laugh] 
Austin: Right. Uh huh. As he- as the sword hits the glass though, and as it starts to slide, there is the sound of thunder overhead. And the like- the room shakes from this thunder. No one- I think everyone looks to Malle, and Malle kind of like… [stammers] uh, strolls back to the throne and sits down. Um… 
Austin (as Fela Malle): The rest of you?
Ali: I don’t know which order we should go in. [laughs]
Austin: Me either. 
Art (as Hadrian): I think you should go next. 
Ali (as Hella): Ok. 
Janine (as Adaire): Yeah, you’re kind of important in this. 
Ali (as Hella): Ok, well… you know? Uh, you know, the biggest ask maybe goes last. I don’t know. 
Ali: Yeah, I guess Hella steps forward and um… It’s tough cause this isn’t like, really a moment cause I don’t think that like, Malle is her rival or anything like that. 
Austin: Right. 
Ali: Not like a super impactful thing. But I do think that like, this is sort of the only power that Hella’s sort of like, shied away from- 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: -and the point of the series. Like, it’s originally her being like, ‘I can’t be- I can’t be in the military cause I don’t want to do that. It’s scary and intimidating.’
Austin: Mhm. 
Ali: And then it’s also just being like, ‘I don’t wanna… I know that they’re doing a bad thing, and I don’t want to try to stop it, so I’m not going to try to.’ Um… so I- you know, I feel like, the moment where she’s actually like, ‘Ok, no. I’m doing that,’ is you know- there’s a-
Austin: Yeah, totally. 
Ali: You see the- the camera pans out, and you see the forty feet that’s between them. And it’s sick. Um. [Ali and Janine laugh] 
Austin: Yep. No, you’re not wrong. [Ali continues laughing] 
Ali: I think that um… Hella says, 
Ali (as Hella): It- it’s been… it’s been a long time since I’ve been home, and it’s been even longer since I’ve had my rightful place here. Ordenna was never meant to be run by one man. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): Ambition! [Ali/Hella exhales laugh] Now this is a surprise. Queen Killer, you had your moment. 
Ali (as Hella): I don’t go by Queen Killer anymore, and my blood is… as glorious as yours is. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): [exhales amusedly] As glorious. 
Austin (as Crowd): [quietly murmuring] Glorious- glori- glor- 
Austin: Whisper, whisper. Um, 
Austin (as Fela Malle): If you wish your name back, that’s in my power. The Aviz clan was exiled and… destroyed for crimes against the Ordennan people. If you wish to carry that mark, [light laugh] more power. But don’t think that makes you my peer.
[0:45:00]
Ali (as Hella): They were exiled and destroyed for… trying to make a forward action in a dying world. And I think that that’s… [laughs] The reason we’re all here is because I’ve proven I can do that. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): Hella Varal, Living Blood of Smoke. [laughs softly] Fine. I grant you the name Aviz, and I grant you the title and whatever limited authority comes with it. To be queen of spirituality in Ordenna today? Is to be queen of nothing at all. [Ali/Hella inhales and exhales deeply] Be sure to say your prayers to Queen Hella everyone when you say them at night. 
Austin (as Crowd): Ha ha.
Austin: Laughs. 
Ali (as Hella): I look forward to giving the Ordennan people something to have faith in. [whispers] So, take that. [laughs]
Austin (as Fela Malle): Any first declarations? Living Blood of Smoke?
Ali: Oh shit. Um… [laughs] 
Austin (as Fela Malle): I’ll be sure everyone hears. 
Ali (as Hella): Um, [exhales deeply] my- my mark and my authority will be felt in time. But um… for right now, I am… Oh, actually, while I have the floor, I just want to say the Queen Killer thing is over. She’s not dead anymore. I go by Death’s Servant now. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): Oh. 
Ali (as Hella): So, if you want to say that out loud, you…
Austin (as Fela Malle): Death’s Servant?
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. Nice to meet you.
Austin (as Fela Malle): Living- Living Blood of Smoke and yet kneels to death. A pleasure, [amused] servant. Mapmaker, Ranger, you have requests? Or is-
Janine (as Adaire): Throndir, you can-
Dre (as Throndir): Since the Golden Lance started in Marielda, I’d be interested in returning back with any of the… original weaponry or designs that came from the forge. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): Now this- this is- this is a request I like. We will set up a- a tour of these facilities and show you not only the power of the Golden Lance of old, but some improvements we’ve made. We believe that there is a good, strong future in a relationship between Ordenna and the Golden Lance. Your treaties with the various powers of Hieron give you access to bring justice, and where justice arrives, so too, can civilization. So, yes. This afternoon. My smartest engineers will show you the places that you wish, and I hope you find something you like. 
Dre (as Throndir): I look forward to it. Thank you. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): Nothing for your dog?
Dre (as Throndir): He is quite content, thank you. 
Austin: [in Malle’s voice] What was that about being cliche? 
Art: Oh no, this was- that was just- I’m just surp- I’m just never- it never stops to surprise me how rude the people we come across are. [Austin and Ali laugh] 
Austin: Oh, Keith would just be losing’ it right now, are you kidding me?
Dre: Oh yeah.
Austin: [laughing] Fero would just have eaten everyone here as a bear. [Janine laughs] 
Art: I killed their dumb dragon, and then they’re like, ‘Your sword sucks.’ Like-
Austin: Did you pick up the other sword, by the way? 
Art: Yeah. 
Austin: [overlapping] Or is it still on the ground?
Art: I went and picked it up. 
Austin: Ok. 
Art: Probably while someone else was talking. 
Austin: Yeah. It-
Ali: [laughing] During the last scene?
Austin: Uh huh. When you do that, there is again another strike of lightning and thunder, just to be a hundred percent clear. 
Art: [over Austin] Yeah, I think something bad’s about to happen. I don’t know. 
Austin: Yeah, dawg. 
Art: Um- [Art laugh lightly; Janine sighs] But like, I don’t know if I can be like, ‘Hey, there’s thunder. We should all just get outta here.’ [hurried whisper] But it feels like we should get outta here.
Austin (as Fela Malle): Mapmaker.
Janine (as Adaire): Yeah. Um... so I saw this boat you have… The like, really big boat with the cool- it’s kind of like a coating or something, right?
Austin (as Fela Malle): You, of course, mean the Gleam of Glory?
Janine (as Adaire): It’s a really good name for a boat. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): You want the boat. 
Janine (as Adaire): I mean, I know it’s a bit of an ask, but um… I know a girl who’s really into boats. [Ali/Hella sighs an ‘aww’] 
Art: Hadrian does the thing where he like, holds up his hand in front of him and like, points. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): [laughs] Yeah. I felt- Ah, ok. I see. It’s the first of its kind. 
Janine (as Adaire): I mean I think that’ll really impress her.
Austin (as Fela Malle): Ambition. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. 
Art: [laughs] Ha! 
Austin (as Fela Malle): Will you turn it into a temple on the sea?
Janine (as Adaire): That’s not really my thing. I didn’t say I was gonna give it to her. I just wanted to show it to her so she’d be really impressed.
Austin (as Fela Malle): Oh, I misunderstood. I thought it was [Janine exhales a laugh] a situation where you were like, ‘I’ll use my request to get a gift for someone who I care about.’ I didn’t-
Janine (as Adaire): We’ve just met. 
Austin: [jokingly in Malle’s voice] I didn’t know this was a ‘Check out my cool ride’ situation. [everyone laughs] 
Janine: [jokingly in Adaire’s voice] You gotta give ‘em something to come back for. 
Austin: [in Malle’s voice] Right. [laughs] Don’t give away the cow. I understand. 
Dre: [groans] Ughh. 
Ali: Wait. 
Art: [uncomfortable] Mm. 
Austin: [in Malle’s voice] You sell the milk. You don’t-
Janine: [in Adaire’s voice] Yeah, don’t give away the cow when… you know-
Austin: [in Malle’s voice] [laughing] -when you have a boat. 
Janine: [in Adaire’s voice] Don’t give away the… I don’t remember. 
Austin: [light laugh] Yeah, uh huh. Um, [exhales] I think uh… [click tongue] he says, 
Austin (as Fela Malle): [exhales deeply] We can build another like it for you. 
Janine (as Adaire): Mm. How long is that gonna take?
Austin (as Fela Malle): A good craft takes time. 
Janine (as Adaire): I mean I don’t mind a lot model. Sometimes they discount those. [Austin laughs; followed by a long silence]
Austin: The attendant who he spoke to before kind of leans over to him and whispers a few times. And he kind of like, 
Austin (as Fela Malle): [hems and haws] Hm. Hm. I will grant you the Gleam of the Glory. The Gleam of Glory if you are authorized to begin a line of trade between our humble city and your encampment. The first of what I suspect will be many exchanges of our new friendship. 
Janine (as Adaire): I mean… I know merchants. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): I suspected as much. 
Janine (as Adaire): That’s achievable. Um, also my dog would like a- like a good chunk of meat. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): Of course!
Janine (as Adaire): Thank you. 
Austin (as Fela Malle): Um, Claft! 
Austin: And one of the nobles off to the side stands up and is like, 
Austin (as Claft): Yes, Sir?
Austin (as Fela Malle): Claft, give this dog your steak. 
Ali (as Hella): Ooo. 
Art: [laughs] Ha! 
Austin: And Claft is like, 
Austin (as Claft): Yes-
Janine: This guy just has a steak?
Austin: Yes, everyone’s eating. This is like, a banquet situation. 
Janine: Oh ok. 
Austin (as Claft): Yes, Sir. 
Janine: [laughs] I forgot about that. 
Austin: And just walks over with a metal plate with like, a cut of meat on it. Um, and I have to tell you, Kodiak whimpers [Austin, Janine, and Ali laughing] as- as he walks past Kodiak-
Janine: Aw. 
Austin: -and puts it in front of Barbelo. 
Dre: Listen. 
Ali: [quietly] Come on, Throndir. 
Dre: Kodiak doesn’t want this fuckin’ morally compromised meal. [Austin laughs hard] 
Austin: Wow!
Ali: Mm. 
Art: Fuckin’ Claft always get the short end of the stick. [Austin cackles again]
[crosstalking] 
Ali: [laughs] I just sort of-
Janine: Can I-
Ali: Oh sorry. I just want to zoom in on the moment where Hella looks at Adaire just like, nodding like, ‘this owns’ cause it does. [everyone laughs] 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah, that’s sick. You just took that guy’s steak. That’s hilarious. [Dre cackles] 
Janine: Can I- can I give Claft a coin? I feel kind of bad for Claft.
Austin: You can give Claft-
Ali: Don’t-
Dre: Don’t give him shit. 
Janine: Just like, one coin. [Austin laughing]
Dre: Fuck him. 
Janine: Just like a tip. [Ali and Austin laugh] 
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: It’s just-
Austin: No, Claft fuckin’ sucks. [laughs] If he was good, he would have eaten his steak. 
Janine: [over Austin] I don’t know Claft. Claft might be ok. 
[crosstalking]
Austin: Anyone- 
Janine: He’s probably not. 
Austin: No one in this room is ok. 
Janine: He’s hangin’ out here. Nevermind. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: Yeah, never- nevermind. 
Austin: [sighs] Um, the uh… As Barbelo begins to bite into this steak, um… I think… Malle says,
Austin (as Fela Malle): Before you sit down, Claft, can you pull back the curtains? I’d like to see the Gleam before it leaves us. 
Austin: And, 
Austin (as Claft): Yeah. [sighs heavily] 
Austin: And it’s like, big curtains, right? It’s like- it’s like a gigantic curtain situation because it’s a huge banquet hall. 
Art: Did they install these curtains?
Austin: Yeah, these are new. 
Art: Wow. 
Austin: Remember when there was like- I told you like, half of the volcano was gone? Now this room-
Art: They turned it into a window. 
Austin: Turned- Put in a window instead of just like, rocks and stuff. Um, he pulls back and reveals that you can see…
Art: [over Austin] That’s impressive. It’s hard to get that much glass. 
Austin: They’re very good, ya know? At that, I guess. Uh, they reveal- you know, you can see the city from here. And at this point, the rain is like- it is raining. It is pouring here. Um… and you can see the Gleam of the Glory- the Gleam and the Glory? The Gleam- Whatever I said before… I have a list of ship names that I always have to go to. And I was actually- this is actually a list of Jack ship names. The Gleam of Glory is the name of this ship. And it is still sitting in that harbor. And he says, 
Austin (as Fela Malle): It’s a beautiful ship. I will be sorry to see it go. We’ll need to replace it quickly. If there’s nothing else, it’s been a pleasure meeting you all. Feel free to find seats. Everyone else, continue with your day. 
Austin: And he sits back down in his weird cinder block throne. And before like, anyone can even start talking again, a new bolt of lightning hits in the middle of the city. Do you- Y’all have seen like, slow motion gIfs of lightning? [brief silence] I’m asking. 
Art: Mhm. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Dre and Ali: Mhm. 
Austin: You know how there’s like, a lead? Like, I don’t know if people actually know this. I- They- I think most- Most people learn this in high school, right? That the way lightning works is that it actually- a lot of it goes upwards, not downwards, right?
Janine: Mhm. 
Austin: That there is a kind of like- a smaller, single chain that goes down, and then it kind of like- the kind of branched snake lightning that we’re used to seeing is the… Boy, we’re gonna yelled at by scientists again if I keep talking, but I’m gonna keep talkin’ anyway. Um, [light laugh] the like, branching lightning is that energy finding a way down, but like, taking the quickest possible paths, which is why it diverts. But like, the first one is the one- the one before the big flash is the one that has like, found the fir- eh, the place- like, the- the pathway down to the ground fastest, basically. And then it like, crackles back upward, but it happens so fast that for us, it reads as happening top to bottom, basically. Um… that happens. You see one of those like, lightning leads fall from the sky in such a way that I think for everyone here, it actually reminds you of the star falling. Um, and I- you know, here’s the thing. It is. 
It is a star falling. But when it hits, instead of just like setting one part of this island on fire, it lightnings upwards. It branches into the sky. I put some gifs in the chat fairly recently about lightning or lightning gifs. I guess I put one video that I’ll send back around. I’ll describe it also because that’s important. Uh- [thinking noise] tchooo- Copy link. Paste link. And then… Uh, this is- this is a video from Twitter user Biggie_66 who says, ‘San Antonio going crazy right now.’ [Austin and Ali laugh] And it is lightning that kind of like- it feels like it’s jittering in the sky. Like, it feels like it’s glitched out because of how long it takes for its like, cycle to complete, if that makes sense. It’s like, it’s stuttering as it works its way upwards through the sky. I guess Dre, you also just put in a really good lightning gif that’s like, slow motion and sort of similar. The thing to think about-
Art: Oh, that’s horrifying. 
Austin: Yeah, dude. Isn’t it scary?
Art: [light laugh] Stop driving towards that.
Austin: [laughs] Um, the… So, that is what’s happening right now. Lightning is hitting the city. And it’s kind of like, stuttering upwards and crashing again and again. And here’s the big thing is when it reaches the top of the sky, it just freezes in place. It doesn’t like, ‘Op! It’s gone now.’ Huge, white-yellow arcs of lightning begin to scar the skies. And Hadrian, at this point, that cloak is like, actually beginning to choke you a little bit. And I think he just says it outright. 
Austin (as Samot): Drop the sword and come back. 
Austin: That is Samot to you, Hadrian. 
Art: Yeah, I know who it is. 
Janine: Running out of contenders on that front. 
Austin: Mhm. 
Ali: Um… [silence]
Art: Um… [silence]
[1:00:00]
Austin: Uh, everyone here- Claft leaps up and is like- Claft doesn’t say a word. He leaps up and leaves. He leaps up, and he leaves upon seeing this. 
Art: Aw, Claft. This is- this is why, Claft has to give- [Austin and Dre laugh hard]
Ali: Mhm. Mhm. 
Art: No one likes you, Claft!
Ali: I have to find Claft and make him my new Isaac Adelton. [Austin continues laughing] 
Art: Um, I guess it’s like, I don’t even know what to- Is this a- I don’t- Is this a roll? Is this something I have to know? Like-
Austin: What are you- what are you- what are you tryin’ to-? What are you asking me?
Art: Can- Who can hide this from Samot?
Austin: The sword. 
Art: The sword. 
Austin: Good question. 
Art: Who can I give the sword to that Samot won’t know has it? [Austin stammers] And it has to be one of the three people I’m with right now. [light laugh] 
Austin: Good question. Does anyone have an ability to like… do that?
Janine: Uh…
Dre: Uh… [Austin breathes a laugh] Uh…
Ali: [overlapped] Wait. 
Austin: I don’t- I don’t think.
Dre: Can I turn the sword into a vampire?
Austin: Probably not. 
Dre: Ok, yeah. Probably not. 
Janine: Would… I guess a bag of holding can’t really… It’s like in a- How does that-
Austin: Oh. 
Janine: How do bags of holding work?
Austin: You- It could hold the sword. 
Janine: But is it like, holding it in like, a pocket universe? Like, how’s-
Austin: [groaning] Yeeeaaahhh. So, yeah. 
Janine: Like, holding it is less the issue than like, holding it secretly, right? [laughs]
Austin: Yeah, the thing here would be… Samot can- Samot… does not have perfect vision here. Um, though wearing his cloak helps that- his vision- quite a bit. 
Ali: Mm. 
Austin: Ya know? We- we introduced this entire premise earlier this year with the- the um- [click tongue] What was Benjamin’s thing again? What was the… the Arrell-Benjamin thing? I keep wanting to say ‘beacon,’ but that’s wrong. That’s wrong, right?
Art: It wasn’t beacon?
Austin: It wasn’t beacon?
Ali: Phylactery? 
Austin: No, he was also a phylactery, but I thought- Maybe it was beacon. Wasn’t it? Mmm.
Art: Was it like- Was it- It wasn’t conduit, was it?
Austin: Conduit! Yes, it was conduit. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: Conduit. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Um, so we- we know that there is like, magic for seeing far places and like, improving vision. So that is definitely a thing, but yeah, if you could get that thing into the bag of holding, like stealthily? I bet Samot wouldn’t know. But also, I wanna be clear, this is not… Uh, him saying that was not like, [exhaled laugh] ‘Come home, and I won’t do the thing I’m doing.’ Um, I think-
Art: Does Hadrian know Adaire has the bag?
[crosstalking]
Janine: It was Samot’s bag. 
Austin: It was Samot’s bag. 
Janine: So like-
Austin: -which I guess like-
Janine: I can’t imagine Adaire would have been super quiet about [laughing] something like that [Austin laughs hard] to be honest.
Austin: Drunk Adaire just being like, ‘Put it in. Put it in the bag. Watch, it’s gonna- Yeah, I know. The whole thing!’ [Janine laughs] ‘It’s gone now. I can pull it out!’
Janine: Just pulling out strings of scarves-
Austin: [laughing] Yeah. 
Janine: -and like, rabbits and bouquets. 
Art: Ok, so I guess Hadrian makes eye contact with Adaire, holds the sword out and drops it, and… and leaves.
Austin: And you can feel like, the cloak getting looser, and he says, 
Austin (as Samot): [relieved] Thank you. I don’t want you hurt in this. 
Art: Does this work both ways? Do you think I can talk to…?
Austin: You can try.
Art (as Hadrian): Stop doing this. 
Austin (as Samot): I can’t. Not until it’s destroyed.
Art (as Hadrian): ...I don’t understand. I don’t understand why it’s worth all this. 
Austin (as Samot): You couldn’t understand, Hadrian. It- [exhales] That sword, the forge… everything I tried… So many ideas. And none of them… none of them were right. None of them saw the big picture. None of them realized that the problem was us. I have to destroy it. 
Art (as Hadrian): You- you don’t. I could… [sighs] There are people here. 
Austin (as Samot): There are people everywhere, Hadrian... Stopping it here only means… The Ordennans are prideful and… cruel. Their vision of civilization is… ill.
Art: [groans] Ohhh, this is so hard because… Hadrian agrees. 
Austin: [light laugh] Yeah?
Janine: There’s not only Ordennans here though. 
Austin: Oh, wait, wait, wait. He’s not done. Let him finish talking. 
Art: Ok. 
Austin: Cause you might not agree with the second part. 
Art: Cause Hadrian does not like Ordenna. 
Austin: Uh- [light laugh] which I think is fine. The bit of where you’re like, ‘Yeah, totally. For sure.’
Art: Yeah. Uh huh. 
Austin: But then he says, 
Austin (as Samot): But they are right about something. [sighs] My kind… We have done nothing… nothing but torture you all… for centuries…. And as long as you know who we are, as long as there is a Hieron, as long as there are stories… about Samol and Galenica and me… there is the possibility… of our return. I need to build a world where reconfiguration can never happen again. Where there are no gods…. A beautiful world… A world that cannot be remade… A world without Ordenna. And a world without me…. But if you- if you all come back now, I- [exhales] There are ways of doing this that aren’t… None of you will be hurt- Come back now.
Art: Oh, I’m tryin’ to decide how much I want this moment…. And just to be clear, the moment is Hadrian throwing the cloak into the volcano. 
Austin: Yeah. Like, under the train, the volcano is bubbling away. 
Art: But it’s- it’s a.... It’s a big choice… 
Austin (as Samot): I wish we could have spoken more, Hadrian. I wish you would have climbed the ladder… It was you- [sighs] It was you or- or Fantasmo, and… he died. And then I put my hope in you in finding some other way. And you helped so many people, but… there is no future in this world that is not one of pain and suffering until some… [exhales] some new polity- some corner of this ruined world dreams up a new god like they did with Galenica. Before Severea blesses someone as Samol did me. Before Fero becomes [sighs] more divine than he already is. We cannot have that world. It will be millennia of suffering again. 
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah, I’ll see you soon. 
Art: And Hadrian throws the cloak into the volcano. 
Austin: [breathes deep] Um, as it hits, lightning begins to strike all around the volcano. 
Art: Yeah, we gotta go. 
Austin: I got an image for you. Real quick, I’m gonna pop this in here. This is a photo by Francisco Negroni of lightning- of like- it’s like, a timelapse of lightning striking a volcano. [someone gasps]
Art: Holy shit! [Austin laughs hard] 
Dre: Yeah. 
Ali: Woah.
Austin: Uh… and it’s like a network. It’s like a mesh of lightning over time, hitting this volcano, but it’s like solidified into a single moment. And like, there’s the orange. And this is what’s happening here now. It’s- it’s like, latticing up above the forge and above- above the volcano. Just this like, intense- It almost looks like veins. It almost looks like- like veins and arteries of lightning, as they kind of scar the sky. And begin pounding away on this mountain. But it is made of strong stuff. Samothes did not play [light laugh] when he built this. Adaire, did you pick up the sword and hide it?
Janine: Hell yeah. 
Austin: Alright. Throndir and Hella, what are you doing? Also, Adaire, what are you doing? What’s the party outside doing? Er inside the banquet room?
Ali: So, people are scattering. 
Austin: People are now scattering. Fela Malle has now probably… [clicks tongue] I think he actually stands and goes to draw the sword and then realizes he doesn’t have the sword. But then he shouts across the room, and he says, 
Austin (as Fela Malle): Death’s Servant, you’re a traitor! This is your doing. Seize her!
Austin: And um… I think a couple of like, human guards begin to move in on you. 
Dre: Um… [thinking noises] da-da da-da-da- [Ali laughs] I’ve got a new move for this. 
Ali: Yeah, take the floor. 
Dre: [reading] ‘I’m never taken by surprise. When an enemy would get the drop on you, I get to act first.’
Austin: Hell yeah, you do. What do you do? There’s three of these guards coming towards you. 
Dre: I mean I really don’t care about them. [Austin laughs] Hella, can very easily take care of them.
Austin: Fair, what are you- [Ali snorts a laugh] Ok, so what’s your- what’s your play here?
Dre: [sighs] Huh… I would really like to just uh, smack this Imperator across the face with the barrel of my gun. 
Austin: [amused] With the barrel of your gun? Ok. 
Dre: Or the butt. I don’t know. Whatever. 
Austin: No, no, no. That’s fine. 
Janine: You want to pistol whimp- whip him. [laughs] 
Dre: Yeah.
Janine: I think. Is that-?
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: Sure. 
Ali: We’re doin’ that? [laughs] 
Austin: Apparently. Throndir’s out here. 
Janine: You got a pistol. 
Austin: It’s more like a shotgun, right? Or like, a rifle? It’s a long arm. 
Dre: It’s like a- Yeah, it’s like a long rifle, yeah. 
Austin: Yeah. Alright, so what do you do? What’s- Give me the- What’s the- Is there a roll on this?
Dre: It’s just Hack and Slash. 
Austin: Alright. Give me that Hack and Slash. Oh, you get like a bonus to that because of… 
Dre: I roll my DEX instead, yeah. 
Austin: Oooo. That’s useful. Your DEX is- your DEX is eighteen. 
Dre: It’s pretty good. 
Austin: Yeah. That’s a thirteen.
Dre: [simultaneously] Uh yeah, thirteen. 
Austin: Holy shit. So wait, is the- Has the secret been this whole time that the reason Throndir has not been doin’ great with this gun is that you’re shootin’ it instead of [laughing] hittin’ people with it?
Dre: Yeah. [Janine laughs] Yeah, I think so. 
Ali: Mmm. 
Dre: Um…
Austin: Umm… do your damage?
Dre: Yeah, and I’m gonna spend one of my Vigor to do an extra d4. 
Austin: Ok. Uh, does this thing have like armor piercing or anything? Probably not, right? Cause it’s-
Dre: I- Probably not when I’m like, smacking somebody with it. 
Austin: Yeah, though- Wait, wait, wait. Here’s a question. Do you- Does it have it when you’re not? When you’re shooting it?
Dre: No, it has forceful. 
Austin: Ok. Ok, forceful’s still good, cause like this could be some like, equilibrium gun-kata shit, ya know what I'm sayin’?
Dre: Oh yeah. 
Austin: This could be like a like, hit the dude in the face, put the gun in his chest, in his armor and pull the trigger type shit. 
Dre: Oh yeah. Kind of what I’m imagining is that like, I almost like, hit him with the butt of the gun, and that like, cracks the barrel open. 
Austin: Yeah.
Dre: And then I like, load the shell in, and then the barrel of the gun actually just hits him upside the chin, as I snap it shut. 
Austin: Love it. Give me that damage. So, it’s d8 plus d4?
Dre: Yep. 
Austin: Ok. 
Dre: Alright, it’s six.
Austin: That’s six. That’s- that’s not nothin’. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: I think it mostly- I think like, you don’t- He like, pulls away- or actually what he does is, as you go to like, do the upward shot, he like, actually pushes forward above you so that it mostly hits the plate of his armor. And like, shoves you away. Uh… 
Austin (as Fela Malle): I need a weapon!
Austin: He calls out, as he like, tries to do a big foot stomp on you. But you roll out of the way. Like, he’s not equipped for this. 
Dre: Oh wait. Hold on. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Dre: I think I add something from Kodiak to this damage. 
Austin: Oh, you do. You almost certainly do. 
Dre: Uh, let’s see. 
Austin: Uh.. it’s in here somewhere. 
Dre: Uh, add its ferocity to your damage. So, that’s plus two, so that does eight. 
Austin: Alright, so, it does- Actually it does better- much better damage. Ok. Um, people are scattering. Those three other guards, I think, are- Is anyone gonna deal with them? What’s poppin’ off with those guards?
Ali: Ok. Um… hm. Those are human guards though?
Austin: Those are human guards. There are still the six anchor who have not done shit. 
Janine: Yesh, I wanted to-
Austin: They explicitly did not respond when he said to seize you. 
Janine: I wanted to talk to them.
Ali: Yeah. 
Janine: And Carlay probably.
Austin: Mhm. 
Janine: Is Carlay still around?
Austin: Uh huh. 
Janine: I wanted to talk to- to them. 
Austin: What do you say? What do you all say?
Janine: [sighs] I think to the anchor I say like, um…
Janine (as Adaire): I know… I know you can hear what I’m saying and act on it if you choose to. I think this is as good as open- as good an opening as any of us are gonna get. Uh, I don’t know how this is gonna shake out, but I do know I have a very strong boat. [Austin laughs] I think it would be a very good idea if you could gather as many- as many other anchor- as many other… vulnerable people, but especially anchor. Especially your people. 
[1:15:00]
Janine (as Adaire, continued): And get to the boat. Carlay, you can hang out here if you want. [Janine and Austin laugh]
Janine: It'd be great- it’d be very fun to fight with Carlay, but I’m not gonna press them on it. 
Austin: Give me a- give me a- give me a Parlay. 
Janine: Um, hang on. I have… Ok, this is a thing. Ok. I was checking Bamboozle which I don’t roll. It’s just a bonus thing- 
Austin: It’s a bonus. 
Janine: -that goes with Parlay. Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah. You take a plus one forward with them. Yeah. 
Janine: Yeah. Um… Ok. 
Austin: That’s a ten. 
Janine: That’s a ten. 
Austin: Hell yeah. 
Janine: And I get that plus one. 
Austin: Um… god. So, I think that you know, they came in with those banners. And I think that they like, nod to you, and they say, um… 
Austin (as Anchor): The Last University is to the north.
Austin: It was one of the- one of the pala-din speaking- one of the anchor speaking. 
Austin (as Anchor): To the north, the center of the continent, yes?
Janine (as Adaire): Uh, yes. 
Austin (as Anchor): Will we be accepted there? Safe?
Janine (as Adaire): [exasperated] I mean we pretty much take- take everyone in. [Austin laughs] We got a real open door policy. 
Austin (as Luiz): I am Luiz. This is Inez, [sighs] Maricado, Vera, and Caj. We will- we’ll see you. We’ll find our way. We’ll bring as many as we can. We’ll bring as many as we can. 
Austin: And then they step forward again, and actually move up to like, stand between Malle and Throndir. Like, in front of you, Throndir. Like as a- as like a wall. And they like, brea- one of them breaks this like, iron banner over- over their- like, their knee, and then like, basically turn them into makeshift spears. And they’re surrounding Malle. Uh, let me tell you, the r- the human Ordennans in this room are not happy. [light laugh] Um, and I think the three guards seeing this- Like one of them charges- I think they would maybe probably all charge the anchor at this point, and they’re dispatched with haste. You know, a sword bounces off of the armor- the back like, pauldron of uh- back right pauldron of one of the anchor who then like, turns and just like, breaks that dude’s arm and kicks him away. Like, there isn’t- they are- the regular soldiers here are not a match for these anchor. Carlay says like, 
Austin (as Carlay): We need to go now. 
Ali: Um… yeah. I don’t know. I was trying to think of an action here, but I think um… everything’s been done. I think that I like, defend the anchor in that fight. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Like, I join in and try to like, I- I guess they don’t need that help. 
Austin: I mean do you want to give me a Hack and Slash to see if you can… 
Ali: Sure. 
Austin: Or like, are you- are you staying to kill Malle or are you… leaving it to them? Like, what’s the play here?
Ali: Yeah, I um… Is Throndir still engaged with him?
Austin: Throndir is safe. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: Throndir is able to like, make some distance because of the anchor and because Malle still doesn’t have a weapon. 
Ali: My immediate thing is like, is neutral Hella gonna kill an unarmed person? But she’s not a jedi. Like, it’s ok. 
Austin: No. No. [Janine and Ali laugh]  
Ali: [laughing] It’s ok. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: Um- [continues laughing] um-
Dre: This dude just shit on your family… and like-
Austin: Mhm. 
Ali: Yeah, no. He sucked forever.
Dre: Yeah. [light laugh] 
Ali: No, I know. Um, yeah, I mean you know, if you have a golden opportunity, you should take it.
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: Um… what did you open on my-? [laughs] 
Austin: I just changed the spelling of something in a- one of your moves. 
Ali: Ok. 
Austin: Sorry.
Ali: Ok. Um… yeah, I would- I would love to- to fight this dude. I don’t know like the… I think that she like- She’s able to… like, walk through the commotion with the anchor, right?
Austin: Yeah, totally. 
Ali: And like, just approach him. 
Austin: Give me your roll. 
Ali: Yeah. Fucking I just gonna- [quietly] Ok, wait. Just want to make sure I just- Maybe I wanna-
Austin: You gonna do a little special somethin’?
Ali: Yeah. I just want to do somethin’- Just look through what I have. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: I- You know, while I’m here, I’d love him to be afraid of me in this moment. 
Austin: Just cause. [Ali laughs]
Ali: Just to see if he would be- [laughs]
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: -before attacking him. So, I’d like- I’m gonna roll Road to Perdition, and then see if I can-
Austin: Alright. 
Ali: -don the visage of Death. 
Austin: Like you do. 
Ali: And that’s twelve. [laughs] 
Austin: Twelve! Yo, what’s good. 
Ali: Good for me. 
Austin: You just achieve your- There’s no cost. There’s no Peace cost. There’s no HP cost. You don the visage of Death. The room grows darker as Hella Varal, Death’s Servant takes a wide stance and powerful stance. 
Ali: Um, yeah. I’m- I’m glad that she gets to be very intimidating in this moment, and she like, basically just walks forward to this dude. [laughs] Like… like, shadows slowly extending behind her. 
Austin: Uh huh. [reading] ‘The target of the spell is afraid. so long as you maintain the spell. Their reaction is up to them. Flee, panic, beg, fight.’ I don’t think I’ve done beg yet, and I think that this is like- I think it’s coming crashing down here. It’s like, again, outside the window, lightning is like, wrapping around this- this structure as if it were like, webbing- as if it were a spider’s web. And he thinks this is all y’all. [light laugh] Um... [Ali laughs] Right? Like-
Janine: We don’t need to disabuse him of that at all. 
Austin: Right? And now you- Like, again, Death’s Servant does some shit with the shadows and stuff, right? 
Ali: Yeah.
Austin: Er this particular visage of Death.
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Um, what do you say that- before he begins to beg?
Ali: I don’t think she says anything. Like, it’s her unsheathing her sword, right?
Austin: It’s just- Oh my god. 
Ali: And it’s like, her fucking…
Austin: Then he’s just like-
Ali: -jacket glowing. [laughs] 
Austin (as Fela Malle): Living Blood- Living Blood of Smoke. I’m sorry. I- [exhales] I mis… I misread your intentions. I… I  underestimated your- your power and your vigor. And ah- of course Ordenna will… We’ll rule together. We have the- the future is bright for Ordenna. With us- my army and- and your spiritual strength returning Ordenna to its roots! A new generation!
Austin: He’s on his knees begging. 
Ali: Um, yeah. I don’t think that she stops the moment of her- [laughs] the movement of her arm pulling her sword out. 
Austin: Do damage as established. You don’t need to roll to Hack and Slash here. It’s your- it’s your damage. It’s d10?
Ali: Fuck. It’s three. 
Austin: Wait, did you roll d10 and do three?
Ali: I did- I did roll d10. 
Austin: Ok uh-
Ali: It was a three. 
Austin: It’s a three. Uh, you stab through his armor. The- the anchor join in with you. 
Ali: Oh nice. 
Austin: Right? Like, I’m not gonna roll this out. He’s begging for his life. But I guess, it is important that you did not like, lop his head off here, you know? [Ali laughs] And- and he dies. 
Ali: Yeah, I mean I think that that’s probably actually the- the interesting thing here is that like, Hella can’t kill her- him on her own right now. 
Austin: Right. Right. Yeah. 
Ali: [laughing] She’s certainly doing her best. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: But she- she, you know.. Um… she’s not at full power. 
Austin: Mhm. 
Ali: So, I think this moment of like, needing the assistance, but also like, getting it is huge. 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. Totally. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: There are people who flee, but who witnessed this moment, and so this news will spread. [light laugh] There was a-
Ali: Oh, this is a gr- Oh, this is a fantastic time to mention that uh, [reading] ‘when I prove myself superior to a person in power, take plus one forward on their followers, underlings, or hangers on.’ [Dre laughs] 
Austin: This the new move you have? Is this-
Ali: Mhm. 
Austin: -Usurper?
Janine: That was a good pick. 
Austin: Uh huh. Do you want to-?
Ali:  I know. I was on the fence. 
Janine: Prescient. 
Austin: Is there something- Do you want to say something here to take advantage of that? Is there like, a- a larger statement you’re making? Or are you just like-
Ali: Uh…
Austin: -leaning on the fact that basically all of those people at this point, you’re gonna get a plus one forward with them?
Ali: You know, my um- my… alignment is to increase my reputation-
Austin: That’s true. 
Ali: -so, I’m gonna kind of let the word get out-
Austin: Gotcha. 
Ali: -and then kind of see how I can leverage. 
Austin: Makes sense. Ok. This is place is being destroyed. Samot is destroying this place. [light laugh] We have- y’all have got to move.
Ali: Yeah. 
Janine: yeah. 
Art: Wherever Hadrian is, he’s surprised it’s taking you this long. 
Austin: That’s my question. What has Hadrian been doing?
Art: I mean I think Hadrian’s trying to get out, but he’s not gonna like-
Austin: Like this has been a couple of moments. It’s like, I’m curious, is there something that’s drawn Hadrian’s attention? Is there- is there… Like, do you go look at those old-
Art: I don’t know. It doesn’t feel safe to take the train.
Austin: No, it doesn’t- That’s true. But also I don’t know how you get back besides that train, honestly. That boat’s kind of far. That boat’s on the other side of this fire river. 
Art: I guess that’s what Hadrian’s been tryin’ to figure out. Like, is there a way out? Um, and I’m not the person who should be figuring things out. [Austin laughs] 
Ali: Mm?
Art: Oh fuck. And… there's no one out there who’s interested in helping me anymore. 
Austin: There’s like, Carlay shows up and is like, 
Austin (as Carlay): We gotta get out of here. 
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah, I agree. Great- great call. 
Austin: I think that they probably head for this train. [light laugh] 
Art (as Hadrian): I just think the train’s gonna get destroyed. 
Austin (as Carlay): It probably will, and we should take it before it does. 
Art (as Hadrian): I don’t-
Austin (as Carlay): Or at least let it bring us over dry land… that isn’t being assaulted by lightning as we speak. What is happening?!
Art (as Hadrian): Oh… [dejected] nothing. [Austin laughs] 
Janine: Can I just run out and be like, 
Janine (as Adaire): Get on the train! Everyone get on the fucking train!
Austin: Uh huh.
Janine: Like, can that-?
Art (as Hadrian): It’s very dangerous on that train. 
Janine (as Adaire): We have no other choices really. 
Art (as Hadrian): Alright. 
Austin: Hella, Throndir? As some of you leave this room to go back out into like, the main hall- the- the train arrival hall, the- a bolt of lightning strikes through the top of the- of the volcano and shatters the glass floor of the banquet hall. And strikes the forge below, directly. 
Janine: Are the anchor ok?
Austin: They have come out with you. 
Janine: Ok. Ok. 
Austin: And y’all have walked- gotta out. 
Janine: I was worried you were doing something super mean there. [light laugh]
Austin: No, yeah. The- the anchor followed you out. They are a hundred percent safe. I would not fuck you over. You got a ten on that Parlay. Also, they’re important to me. So, they’re not hurt, and that’s how it works. Cause it’s my game. [Ali and Janine laugh] Um… look through the- look through the- look down the barrel of a gun. That’s what they say. Unless you really like ‘em. Um… and I guess it’s like, all of you are now just in that- the place where the train is. And it’s a little hectic. And I also think… Yeah, I- What do you do? Adaire, let’s start with you since you just rushed into this space. 
Janine (as Adaire): [laughing] We should probably get on the fucking train, right? Like, this place, uh… I don’t know how god forges hold up under whatever the hell this is, but I’m not super interested in trying my odds. 
Ali (as Hella): Wel- well, we- we have to be able to stop it, right?
Janine (as Adaire): [laughing] Why? Why would that be true?
Ali (as Hella): Well, cause… [laughs] cause we have the vision sword. Just stab the sky. [Austin laughs hard] 
Art (as Hadrian): Just stab the sky. 
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. [laughs] 
Austin: With the vision sword. 
Ali (as Hella): And then it’ll go [foley] ‘fwishhh’. And it’ll be-
Austin: Ok, ok. 
Art: I think-
Austin: [amused; Ali laughs throughout] I wanna be- Mmm… I- I gave you the vision. I don’t think I said it’ll go- What was the sound?
Ali:  [foley] ‘Fwishhh’. [laughs]
Austin: [amused] Could you imagine the finale of Hie- Spring in Hie- Finally after five years- [laughs] Hieron comes to a close. Hadrian swung a sword-
Janine: Not with a bang, but with a- with a ‘fwisssh.’
Austin: With a- [laughs] Yeah. ‘Fwissh.’ Done. 
Art: ‘Fwissh.’ Yeah, uh, it ended with kind of like, the- like, a window- a windshield wiper sound. Like a…
Austin: Very poetic. [Ali laughs] 
Art: Yeah. Um, yeah, it turned into an Alanis Morissette video at the end. [Austin and Ali laugh] It was… 
Austin: Ughhh. 
Art: All that talk about mountain goats, and we- and we swerved you with Alan- Alanis. [Austin and Ali laugh] 
Austin: With Alanis. 
Ali (as Hella): Anyway, I asked my girlfriend about this, she said that the sword was important. This guy is fucking us over. I- We have to stop this. We can’t just let this whole city go down. Ev- everything-
Austin: Uh- [Ali laughs] 
Ali (as Hella): This is gonna happen everywhere maybe. I don’t know. We gotta try. 
Janine (as Adaire): Are you sure this isn’t like, a crossed wires thing? Like, are you sure Adelaide wasn’t like, ‘Get this sword. You’ll need it in a week.’?
Ali (as Hella): No, there was a mind palace. I’m sure about this. [Austin laughs] I asked her about Marielda. 
Janine (as Adaire): [laughs] What? …[quietly and overlapped] How many palaces does she have?
Art (as Hadrian): Well, why didn’t you ask her what to do with it? [Austin and Ali laugh] 
Austin: I think Luiz and the anchor are like… 
Austin (as Luiz): Alright, um… We know where there are some boats hidden that can cross the river. We had them set up ahead of time because Carlay told us the whole- 
Austin: Also, Carlay is gone. Carlay vanished some- [Ali and Janine laugh] They just- they just bounced. Um… 
Austin (as Luiz): I’m gonna- [sighs] We’ll go get those set up and start moving people towards the bigger boat. That way we can all just leave whenever you’re done stabbing the sky. I will wait for you with- for one boat. As long as I can. But it’s bad out there. So please hurry.
Austin: And the other anchor are like, 
Austin (as Other Anchor): Great. 
Austin: One of the other anchor- I think Inez is like-
Austin (as Inez): Great to meet you all. This… Have- Good luck. 
Austin: And the whole group like, skitters away. Skitters is the wrong word. They don’t skit- they don’t like, do the Castille- [everyone laughs] 
Dre: [impersonating Zoidberg from Futurama] ‘Woob woob woob woob woob.’
Austin: Could imagine if they all just do the Castille fuckin’ wall like, spider walk? Bye. [foley of skittering] ‘tsi-tsi-tsi-tsi-tsi’
Ali (as Hella): It was nice meeting you!
Austin: Um, and yeah. 
Art (as Hadrian): They’re gonna make fun of us forever. [Austin laughs hard] That’s gonna be the story they tell. These people came from the north, and they were like, pretty great heroes, and then at the end, they were like, ‘let’s wave a sword at the sky until the lightning stops.’
Austin: Ok. 
Janine (as Adaire): ‘We have long enough blades, too.’
Ali (as Hella): But we’re gonna do it, and the lightning’s gonna stop. 
Janine (as Adaire): I don’t-
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah, now we have to make it work so that when they tell that story, it’s about how cool we are. 
Austin: See?
Janine (as Adaire): We don’t have any reason to think this is gonna be anything. 
Austin: Ok, uh- Hella succeeded on the roll. [Austin and Ali laugh] It was not a mixed success. I just-
Janine: Adaire doesn’t know that though. 
Austin: I know. You’re right. You’re right. 
Janine: Adaire’s just being told ‘Get the sword out of your bag.’
Austin: I appreciate it. 
Janine: ‘Wag it at the sky, and all the lightning will stop.’
Austin: Ohh, also it’s in your bag, right? [Ali laughs] 
Janine: Ok, um… I need to roll to [laughing] take things out of this bag. [Ali laughs]
Austin: [shouting] Oh my god! Do you?
[1:30:00]
Dre: [laughing] Oh no!!
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: Oh no. 
Ali: Aus- Austin, can you just tell me if this is gonna work before we [laughing] dedicate this time to this?
Austin: No, I’m not gonna tell you. I mean… [laughs] 
Ali: Is it a metaphor or not? [laughing] Just tell me. 
Austin: I can’t tell you that. 
Janine: Ok. Um… 
Austin: How’s this roll work?
Art: Hadrian is spending all of this time explaining to Hella what a metaphor is. [Art and Austin laugh] 
Art (as Hadrian): Sometimes divine beings don’t speak in absolute terms. They speak-
Ali (as Hella): Oh, Adelaide is very absolute. I don’t know what kind of problem you have. [Dre and Austin laugh] 
Janine: Ok. 
Austin: Tell me how this roll works before you roll it. 
Janine: [reading] ‘A bag of holding is larger on the inside than the outside. It can contain an infinite number of items, its weight never increases. When you try to retrieve an item from a bag of holding, roll plus wisdom.’ I have a one wisdom. ‘On a ten plus, it’s right there. On a seven to nine, choose one: you get the exact item, but it takes a while, [Ali laughs] you get a similar item [Janine and Austin laugh hard] the GM’s choice, but it only takes a moment. No matter how many items it contains, a bag of holding it always zero weight.’ That’s not relevant.
Austin: Give me that roll. 
Janine: Ok. 
Art: I wonder what’s similar to this. 
Austin: I- Good question. [laughs] 
Janine: Another sword.
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: A different sword. Yeah. [Ali laughs] 
Dre: Oh god. [Ali sighs] 
Janine: Uh…
Dre: Can we- 
Ali: [whispers] Oh my god. 
Dre: Can we even aid on this?
Ali: [overlapping] I’m so sorry. 
Austin: Yeah, we- you- can you aid? Can someone hold the bag? [laughs] 
Ali: I would love to- I mean… [Janine laughs] I would love to.
Art: Hadrian could just- We could describe the sword. [light laugh] 
Janine (as Adaire): I probably have to go in there with both hands.
[crosstalking]
Austin: Yeah, Hella Va-
Ali: You take a plus-
Austin: Take a-
Janine (as Adaire): So, if someone could hold the bag, that would be fantastic.
Ali (as Hella): Yeah. 
Ali: You have- it’s plus one, Adaire. I’ve aided you. Um, I’ve given you this idea. I’m [laughs] like-
Janine: Ok. 
Ali (as Hella): Just take in- Yeah, I’ll hold the bag cause you need your arms free to stab the lightning, I think. Adaire, I’m sorry.
Janine (as Adaire): Ok. Oh god. Ok, it’s fine. 
Janine: Um… [overlapped] let me take this-
Art: You know lightning conducts electr- you know, swords conduct electricity. 
Austin: That’s a seven. Which means-
Janine: I got a seven. 
Austin: Which means-
Ali: Oh…
Art: It’s an eight. 
Janine: Wait, I- 
Austin: Eight. 
Janine: Ok, no. Yeah, that’s-
Ali: Eight. That’s an eight. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: An eight is no different than a seven in this system. 
Janine: No, I already added the one.
Austin: Oh-
Janine: I already added the one. 
Austin: Ok, so that-
Dre and Art: Woof. 
Austin: -did really mean a lot, huh?
Dre: Yep. 
Janine: Yeah. [Ali sighs heavily] 
Austin: Uh so, that means what? It takes longer?
Janine: I mean there’s- there’s no real choice here. Like-
Austin: I just- No, I’m just asking. Is that what it says?
Janine: Pulling out something similar is foolish, so yeah- It’s says um, ‘on a seven to nine, you get the exact item, but it takes a while.’
Austin: Ok, so here is what happens. You’re like, reaching around for this fucking sword, and you keeping pulling out other different things that are not the sword. And the train gets destroyed. A bolt of lightning crushes not just- it doesn’t hit where the train is, it hits like, downrail, and it makes the rail like, descend out into the water. And the train rolls away. Um…
Art: That’s probably good that we weren’t on that train. 
Austin: Uh, the- the lightning keeps hitting. Where do you go… as you’re looking through this thing? Like if you stay here, this is not necessarily a safe place. So, I- I kind of want a scene of y’all moving through this place while you’re looking for this sword. 
Janine: I feel like I don’t understand this place enough to move through it. 
Austin: I can pull up some old fuckin’ maps.
Dre: Running through these hallways, throwing shit out of the bag and just a horrible trail behind us,
Austin: I need to go to our Patreon.
Janine: I don’t know that I want to throw it away. I can just put it back inside. 
Austin: If everyone signs up for the Mapmaker level, the ten dollar or more a month level, you’ll find that you have access to the mapmaker bonus. And the mapmaker bonus lets you see all sorts of cool stuff like, the maps from Marielda, which I need because that is where the map of this place exists. 
Art (as Hadrian): We didn’t get the money! [Ali blows out a laugh] 
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah. 
Austin: Man, Samot-
Dre (as Throndir): No, yeah. 
Janine (as Adaire): I got like-
Austin: -has bad taste. 
Janine (as Adaire): I have cult money, so I’m ok. I have three hundred and five money from a cult.
Austin: You also-
Janine (as Adaire): So, it’s ok. 
Austin: Y’all are doing a coup. [light laugh] The mon- You get the money later. [laughs] 
Ali: Yeah. 
Austin: Once the coup is over. 
Ali (as Hella): I think I own that money now. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Art (as Hadrian): They’re all- No one- There’s no- I don’t think there’s a coup- I don’t think this is gonna make it. [Ali laughs] 
Austin: Great. Uh, where is it? Where is it? Where is it? Here we go. Alright. Here we go. I should have just put this in this chat right away. 
Ali: [sighs] We’re fucking in it. 
Austin: Boom. Uh huh!
Ali: I’m so sorry that if we missed this train for the sword and it doesn’t do anything because I ruined it for us.
Austin: Y’all are in it. 
Dre: Eh, it’s fine. 
Austin: [over Dre and Ali] Alright, so- so- so- so- so, you see floor four where Ethan is. [light laugh] You’re in a station. It’s like a rectangular room. 
Janine: I don’t see anything. What are you-
Austin: I posted it in the chat. 
Janine: Oh, ok. Ok. I was expecting it to be in the- in the thing. 
Austin: No. This is old. This is from years ago. 
Janine: Ok. Alright. 
Austin: You’re in this room. And it’s connected to- Do you see that reception to the south where there are five weird color circles? The floor three one. You go down- like, that is now one big thing, and so that is like- that’s one big thing. And then to the east where there is like the- where it says Primo, that’s where you were before. You were in that reception hall with the glass floor. 
Ali: Oh. 
Austin: Uh, those things that are like, red and black used to be stair images, but now are ‘broken image link’ images- [Austin and Ali laugh] -by the time I took this- these photos, and so you have to pretend that those are stairs connecting different floors. Um, and also, you need to… know that the… Each of the… you don’t need to know. You don’t need to know about the different um… bedrooms. But if you got to the bottom left, you can kind of see a weird sideways view of this place where it’s like, ‘There’s the train coming in on the fourth floor. And then the throne room is like, right there. And then the dining room is over there. And etcetera.’ It’s basically like a big volcano cylinder that has rooms built vertical on top of each other. It’s like, a four floor- it’s more than four floors at this point, but like, this map is of four floors.
Janine: Ok, well, I think that we should go to the divine forge and ask Maelgwyn what he thinks we should do. [laughs] 
Austin: That’s where Maelgwyn is. I mean that is where the lightning has struck, right? There’s literally a huge-
Janine: Yeah. That  wasn’t a serious suggestion. [laughs]
Austin: -a huge- Uh, you know?
Dre: No, I mean like…
Ali: That’s where you stab the lightning. 
Dre: Yep. Mhm. [Ali laughs] 
Janine: Oh god. 
Dre: Yeah, no. I mean that’s- that’s where we go. 
Austin: So, yeah, do we get that?
Ali: Adaire… 
Austin: Do we get y’all running down stairwells-
Art: Yeah. 
Austin: -running past the thrones, running down through the storage room, which at this point- I mean back then, the storage room held a bunch of shit that Samothes was too sad to look at. Like, his like, home videos, basically. [laughs] That were contained in weird crystal form. But now probably also holds a bunch of deactivated and destroyed anchor. It probably holds a lot of money. Remember when they were like, ‘We got rid of all the ritual- like, the old uh, religious shit’? I bet a lot of it is just in storage. That they did not totally destroy it yet. So, there’s probably some of that stuff here. There’s probably like, versions of different anchor designs that haven’t been finalized that are here. Um… so yeah. And I think it’s while you’re pulling through- going through there that you get the sword out. I’m going to read about the sword. One second. Just to make sure there’s no- I didn’t have like, a clear description. Oh, this is-
Ali: Can lightning be backstabbed? [Dre laughs] 
[crosstalking]
Janine: I don’t think it has a front. 
Art: We’re not doing damage to lightning. [Ali laughs] 
Austin: Uh-
Janine: I also don’t think my dog’s invisibility powers extend to lightning. 
Austin: Well, as you emerge into the divine forge, which is like, a disc uh, that is floating above the- the magma below. Um, there is lightning that has kind of like, pierced down through it and thrown parts of it up in the- up in the air. So, there’s like- Imagine- imagine a- like, a disc. Like a frisbee shape, right? That’s like, the shape of the divine forge, but it’s real big. And then imagine it’s made of stone. And then imagine that like, someone has like, exploded a bomb or like, jackhammered it. And so there’s like, dust and uh, rocks that are like, mid-flying up in the air that are frozen in the air.  Like, in the aura of where this lightning has struck. So, there’s like a hole driven through it, but some of the material has been like, thrown up in the air and is kind of like, hanging there. And this like, white-yellow lightning bolt is like, pulsating and vibrating, and it’s like… uncomfortable to look at. Um, and there is a form that emerges from it that is a star. A star kind of like, walks out of the lightning bolt and stands between you and it. 
Art: Um… hold on. I have a thing for this. 
Art (as Hadrian): Ok. You’ve been deceived. This is a horrible thing you’re doing. I demand that you stop and let everyone out of here.
Austin: What is-
Art: This is me Making a Stand-
Austin: What is-
Art: -and calling out someone’s villainous actions-
Austin: Mm. 
Art: -and demanding they stand down. 
Austin: What’s the roll? What is the-
Art: Charisma. 
Austin: What is your charisma?
Art: Uh, two. 
Austin: And you rolled the worst possible roll. 
Art: Oh, I hit it. I didn’t think I hit it. Oops.
Austin: You did. You rolled a four. 
Art: Yeah, it’s- it’s two ones. And plus two. 
Austin: Um-
Art: Snake eyes. 
Austin: Yeah. Uh… The um… The star, who I have a name for this star. 
Art: Oh, I’m glad toward the end of all things I’m back at the beginning fucking up this move. [Ali laughs]
Austin: Mhm.
Art: This is just an- This is just an alternate version of the move I had. [Austin laughs]
Austin: Uh huh. This is Cir- Circumflex. Circumflex, and Circumflex um… steps forward and produces in their hand a huge warhammer out of their own selves [Janine sighs] um, and says, 
Austin (as Circumflex): We are driving villany from this world. 
Austin: And then slams the hammer into you with like, [overlapped] remarkable speed.
Art: [over Austin] Ok, I have a- I have a question. 
Austin: Yes. 
Art: Um, I have a move that alt- that- that alters this move. It’s says, [reading]  ‘If your foe attacks you-’
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: ‘-you get plus one Payback.’
Austin: What’s Payback?
Art: Uh, Payback is a- is a resource for something else. 
Austin: Alright, you get that Payback.
Art: Alright, so I’m getting a Payback?
Austin: You’re getting a Payback. You’re also gonna get some damage. 
Art: Yeah, I- I believe that. I’m just- Cause the- one of the options is they can attack me, so-
Austin: Oh. Yeah, well they’re doin’ that. 
Art: But that’s not why they did it.
Austin: No, they’re just doing it to do it. 
Art: But it- but it seems like it still fits the move. 
Austin: I see what you’re saying. 
Art: Yeah. 
Austin: Yes. Uh, four damage. That’s not too bad. 
Art: Uh, is that- that goes through armor?
Austin: It does not. 
Art: Alright. 
Austin: That’s just- it’s an ar- it’s a hammer made of the starstuff. 
Janine: So… to be clear, the play here is actually to stab some lightning in the back.
Austin: It’s up to y’all. [Janine sighs and laughs]
Dre: I mean seems pretty- seems pretty obvious at this point. 
Art: I don’t know, killing a star last time didn’t do a lot. 
Austin: No-
Janine: There’s two things though. It’s the star in front of the lightning, right?
Austin: There’s a star in front of the lightning. The star is trying to defend the lightning. 
Janine: And that star is… into Hadrian right now. 
Austin: Pro- Well, I don’t think that’s true. 
Janine: I mean not- I- I know- I know- I know- I know. I’m just saying. 
Ali: I mean there’s a play here where like- Ok. Hadrian, star, lightning. If like, Adaire goes for the lightning, and then me and Throndir move in between Adaire and the star-
Austin: Mhm. 
Ali: -behind them, then you know…
Austin: Mhm. [Ali laughs] 
Ali: She’s protected. Yeah. 
Dre: Assuming Adaire is ok with stabbing lightning. 
Austin: I will be clear, this thing is not like, into Hadrian in the sense that’s like, ‘Now they’re in a melee.’
Ali: Right. 
Austin: It stepped forward and slammed its hammer into Hadrian. 
Ali: Yeah.
Austin: Like, it is- it is still in a defensive position. I’m not saying that you can’t make rolls to get past it, but you will need to make rolls to past it. 
Dre: Sure. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Uh, I think Throndir looks at Adaire and like, puts his hand out in a way to basically signal like, ‘If you don’t wanna try this, I’m willing to.’
Janine: I mean, I’m really good at stabbing stuff in the back. 
Dre: Fair. 
Janine: I super don’t- Here’s the thing. I don’t want to try it, but if anyone should… probab- probably?
Austin: Mhm. 
Janine: I got a lot of stacking… stacking things. I don’t have anything that prevents lightning hurting me really badly. But-
Dre: I mean, if I die I just turn into a red mist and reappear somewhere else. 
Ali: You do have those gloves on, so I feel like you’re safe. [everyone laughs] 
Austin: Who goes? Someone-
Ali: Yeah, I’m gonna backup Hadrian either way, so y’all decide who’s gonna stab- 
Art: Yeah. 
Ali: -this lightning.
Art: Oh, I would also like to say that this counts as cowardice, treachery, or selfishness. 
Austin: Yeah, sure. And also, the stuff Samot is doing is definitely the other one. 
Art: Yeah, I’m gonna take- So, I’m gonna take four total Payback. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Janine: Man… I wish I just had that list of like, max damage [Austin exhales a laugh] that everyone does. 
Ali: Oh, I’m d10. 
Art: ….I’m also-
Janine: No, I mean… Yeah. 
Austin: Wait, what do you mean?
Art: Do you want- I mean I can- Do you want me to- I can burn a righteous anger to try to… to catch my foe off guard, which I think would be your best chance here?
Austin: That would probably help. 
[crosstalking]
Art: Yeah, just- just do it. I’ll- I’ll catch ‘em-
Janine: Yeah. Just-
Art: I’ll do the off guard, and you just do it. Yeah. 
Janine: Just gonna do it. 
Austin: So, wait-
Janine: I probably have to Defy Danger to actually get there, right?
Austin: -what is the off- What is the off guard thing?
Art: I can spend a Payback to act suddenly and with convict- conviction catching your foe off guard. 
Austin: So, do-
Art: -which I would try to time-
Austin: Yes. 
Art: -so that Adaire can get there. 
Austin: So, you should do that first so that know if it’s-
Art: Alright, so I will do that, and then it’s just like- it’s just Hack and Slash?
Austin: I… I guess. Wait, what is the- what is the actually name? Is this Payback Time?
Art: Yeah, this is Payback Time. It’s an option under Payback Time. 
Austin: Yeah, here’s what I’m gonna say. I still think it’s Hack and Slash to see if you do damage, but the- the catching them off guard I think… gives Adaire a plus one on the Defy Danger. Does that make sense?
Art: Sure. 
Austin: That’s my house rule. Go ahead and give me a Hack and Slash so we can know what this looks like- That’s an eleven. 
Art: Alright. Um-
Ali: Oooo. 
Art: And I will also Shield Bash that.
Austin: Ok. Which is another additional, but you take more damage, right? Or you get a minus one forward or something?
Art: Yeah, I take minus one armor forward. 
Austin: So, there you go. 
Art: In exchange for dealing plus 1d6 damage. Um, I will also… do the 1d6 damage from getting a ten plus. 
Austin: On Hack and Slash. So, it’s gonna be your full damage, which is d10 plus 1d6, plus 1 d6. So- so 1d10 plus 2d6.
Art: So, there’s 1d10. 
Austin: Fwoof. So that is a total of fifteen. 
Ali: Ooo. 
Austin: Uh, here is a thing you-
Art: Well, it’s a total of seventeen. 
Austin: Seventeen, oh sorry. Seventeen. My bad. It’s- Here’s the thing. As you strike this thing with your- the first set, um- Actually, I think- actually, all of this- None of this breaches what you would think of as the star’s armor. Um, you’re hitting it with what it’s made of. It does not pierce itself in that way. 
Art: Even the Shield Bash part?
Austin: The Shield Bash part especially doesn’t because the shield doesn’t breach armor anyway. 
[1:45:00]
Art: Cause *he has more than five or four-? I don’t know how we decide these dice. 
(*Circumflex uses they/them.)
Austin: No, I’m sorry. It takes damage. It’s taking damage. 
Art: Oh. 
Austin: It’s taking damage after you have to get through its armor. 
Art: Got it. 
Austin: So, you’re still doing significant damage here. But its armor is… is in effect is the- is the important thing here. So, instead of doing-
Art: Sure.
Austin: -yeah, seventeen, you do twelve. 
Art: That’s a lot. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: I’m not- I’m not sad about that. 
Austin: No. What’s it look like to draw its attention away to give Adaire that plus one?
Art: I think it’s like- it’s like, exceptionally clumsy, right? Like-
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: You know, Hadrian is- is a- is a doofus, but he’s- he is good at this part. Ya know-
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: -Hadrian is a skilled combatant, and this is just like, Hadrian like, throwing ev- it’s like, he’s throwing his- he’s throwing the- he’s like, hittin’ with the shield. He’s stabbing with this like- it’s like- and it looks like a- like, an awkward tackle because it’s just about like- it’s just- it’s like- the closest to just shouting ‘Look at me! Look at me! Look at me!’- [Austin laughs] 
Austin: Yeah. Ok. Um… 
Art: -Hadrian can do.
Austin: Adaire and anyone helping with the- with the Defy Danger?
Dre: Can only one person help?
Janine: This is-
Austin: One person can help, yeah. With-
Janine: Also, this is a DEX- This is probably a DEX roll. 
Austin: For you, yeah. 
Janine: And I have three DEX, so-
Austin: Yes. You could also not help, if you don’t- Yeah, totally. 
Janine: And- 
Austin: Uh, you have three DEX plus one from- from the thing Hadrian already did, so-
Janine: Oh, right. Yeah. So, I-
Austin: 2d6… plus three, plus one. 
Ali: Yeah, I um, if I’m gonna assist here, I would like to on the stab bit.
Austin: Sure. 
Ali: Is that a- Does that seem a weird way to cut that? Ok. 
Austin: Mh hm. It works. 
Janine: I basically have to roll better than three- 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Janine: -and I’m ok. 
Austin: Alright, so you’re saving- you’re saving this here? You’re waiting on that?
Ali: I am, yes. 
Austin: Ok. Throndir, you’re also just gonna like, wait to see if there’s an opening for something else?
Dre: Yeah, I guess so. 
Austin: Ok. 
Janine: I hope I don’t regret everything I just said. [Ali laughs] 
Austin: 2d6 plus four is not a bad roll.
Ali: Oh my god, the number wasn’t loading for like, [overlapped] the longest-
[crosstalking]
Austin: Ohhh. [Janine laughs]
Art: Yeah, me, too. I saw no number. It was-
Ali: What the fuck?
Austin: It’s still only a nine though.
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: If only someone had helped. Um… [Ali make uncomfortable noise] [thinking noise] da-da-da-da So, hard outcome… uh, sorry, ‘worst outcome, hard bargain, ugly choice.’ It doe- You get to the lightning. If you swing on that lightning before you hit, it hits you. 
Janine: Wait, what?
Austin: You’re- er sorry, not before you hit it, but like, you’ve hesitated here. It’s going to get an attack in, if you’re the one who swings on this- on this thing. Like, you can- you can turn and face it here, and try to like, defend yourself, but… it has- it has seen you so, even though you’re able to hit the lightning if you want to, it is also going to be able to hit you. The star.
Janine: You’re not saying the worst part of what’s happened is that I don’t get the backstab.
Austin: …Nah, the- you’re- you can’t backstab lightning. Lightning doesn’t have a back. 
Janine: [deflated] Oh, you said it was like, doing something. [light laugh] 
Austin: No, the thing there is just like, you’re gonna get the-
Janine: I don’t know if my attention’s- attention’s focused. M’kay. 
Austin: There was not-
Ali: Oh, that was the- that was the star, not the lightning. 
Austin: Yeah, you could backstab the-
Janine: [heavy sigh] Ok...
Austin: -the- the star has a back. 
Janine: This is a mistake. Ok. Uh...
Ali: Aw. 
Austin: [light laugh] I did not understand that you were trying to backstab lightning, which I would have-
Janine: I thought it was like, doin’ stuff, and its attention was focused. That’s-
Austin: The- the star’s attention is focused. 
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: The- the lightning is just lightning. The lightning is like a- is a… the lightning is not just lightning. The lightning is a big, magical thing that Samot is doing to try to create a new world, but it is not alive- 
Janine: Yeah. 
Austin: -or it’s alive the way the stars are alive, but the way the star- a wall made of the stars is alive, not the way a star who steps forward is alive. Um… the thing that you were rolling there for was to not get hit immediately-
Janine: Yeah, was-
Austin: -by this thing, right?
Janine: Yes. Sure.
Austin: So, you’ve drawn its attention is the problem. That is what has happened with the hesitation. Um, it will get to do its damage [Janine exhales a sigh] if you swing. 
Ali: Oh, isn’t there a… I would-
Dre: Is this an opportunity where we could roll Defend?
[crosstalking]
Austin: You could totally-
Ali: Yeah, I was about to say that, yeah. 
Austin: Someone could totally roll Defend.
Ali: I would like the Defend- or Throndir can. I don’t want to take the opportunity away. 
Austin: Yeah, Throndir did say it there, and did kind of set up-
Dre: Yeah, I’ll do it. 
Austin: Yeah. Ok. So, give me a Defend. 
Dre: That’s just CON, right?
Austin: It is just… I believe it’s… [thinking noise] Let me check. Let me double check. 
Dre: Yes. Constitution. 
Austin: Ok. 
Dre: That’s seven. Ok. 
Austin: And a seven says… something… 
Dre: Um, let’s see. 
Austin: [quietly] Where can I find… there we go. 
Dre: So, on a seven, I hold one-
Austin: Yes. 
Dre: -and I can use that one to do certain things. 
Austin: Yeah. [reading] ‘As long as you stand in defense, when you or the thing you defend is attacked, uh… you may spend hold one for one to redirect an attack from the thing you defend to yourself, halve the attack’s effect or damage, open up the attacker to an ally giving that ally a plus one forward, or deal damage to the attacker equal to your level.’ So, what’s it look like for you to stand in defense of- of Adaire and Hella? 
Dre: Uh… 
Austin: If we’re gonna go do the sword thing. 
Dre: So, you said one of the options is just I take the damage?
Austin: Yeah, but I just- Before we even decide what that is, what’s it look like as the three of you move towards this lightning?
Dre: Um… I mean I think it might just be as simple as like, Throndir just like, jumps in front. 
Austin: Ok. Um, cool. Let’s do all these rolls at once then. You do not need to do a Hack and Slash to this thing, but you do need to do damage. I’m just gonna have Adaire and Hella both roll damage. 
Ali: Sure. 
Austin: Throndir, are you taking the hit here, basically?
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: Ok. Only four damage. Why is it only four damage to you, Throndir?
Dre: Cause I’m a vampire. 
Austin: Oh, right- so, is this just like, the hammer hits you, and you go like, ‘Whatever’?
Dre: I mean yeah. I- It- it hurts, but it’s not that bad. I died bef-
Austin: Starstuff doesn’t do… extra-
Dre: I died before.
Austin: That’s true. That is true. Uh, starstuff doesn't do extra damage to vampires? Or to you?
Dre: Um… I don’t think so. 
Austin: Ok, I was just checkin’. Listen. I know fire does, but I know this is different than that. 
Dre: So, when I fail a roll, you can introduce a new weakness, but- 
Austin: [over Dre] I can, but you have not failed a roll. 
Dre: I- I haven’t failed anything this session. Yeah. 
Austin: Good call. Adaire and Hella, what is your- what-
Janine: I rolled a five. 
Austin: You rolled a five. 
Ali: Yeah.
Austin: And Hella?
Ali: I rolled a one. 
Austin: You rolled a one…. Ok. 
Ali: [whine/laughing] What’s going on with me?
Austin: Uh, what’s this- So at this point, you have this sword. Um, and it like- You saw this sword upstairs, and it- You know, remember Fela Malle said like, ‘I thought it was just sharp.’ Well… that’s because uh, it was not reacting to starstuff at the time. Because you pull it out of your bag, and it is immediately glowing in the same way that it was in Hella’s vision. With that kind of warm glow. I didn’t say this before, but I think it causes a glow that makes everyone just look fuckin’ hot. [laughs] Like, I think- [voice cracks lightly] [Ali laughs] the light that radiates from it is just good lightning. You know when you’re like, ‘Wow, this is good lightning. I look good.’
Janine: So, it’s a circ- it’s like, one of those fuckin’ circle lamps?
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: It’s-
Austin: If it’s- if that’s what you need~ in that moment. Yes. But- but I- I don’t even think the light looks the same on all of you. It’s not just a light source in the sense that you- It’s not doing illumination. It’s lighting things well [light laugh] in ways that make no sense. 
Janine: What if someone looks best in the shadows?
Ali: Ooo. 
Austin: Well, then the- I guess there’s like, the most dynamic shadow cast on them, but like, the- the light is like- like, enhancing it. Like, by contrast, you know?
Janine: It’s probably really disorienting to [laughing] look at this thing. 
Austin: Um, here’s a thing. So, I described this sword before as being cast in the same mold or like, design- in the same design as the original Samothes sword that he was making for- for Maelgwyn, but uh, before we recorded, I checked, and I never described that sword. The sword that Ephrim has. Like, I described the crescent blade part of it when he found it in the um- underneath the- the- the univer- er not the university, the um… museum in Rosemerrow. And I maybe described the hilt- maybe I described the hilt once, but they were like separate weird things, and they came together to be a new different sword, and I’ve never described it. And so, what the fuck does the sword that Samothes designed for Maelgwyn to kill him with look like? Cause this would look like the same sword. Is it- is it just like, a long saber? Is it a long sword? Does it have like, a cool- like, wrap around hilt? Does anyone have a sword we haven’t put on screen yet that’s like a favorite sword from your- from your like- your pinterest board? Your pinterest sword board? I- I-
Janine: Honestly, probably. 
Austin: I mean yeah, I know. I- I’m not joking. 
Janine: I just saw a bunch of- Hang on. I now have- I need to- I took a picture- I took pictures of a lot of swords in Copenhagen. Like, a lot. 
Austin: God bless. 
Janine: Like, dozens. 
Austin: God bless. 
Janine: Some of them were… very powerful. 
Austin: [over Janine] Also, start dropping those in- start dropping those in season six, also. 
Janine: Ye- Oh, ok. 
Austin: People have dress swords sometimes. 
Janine: What if I just put them there to save time?
Austin: That’s fine. 
Janine: And you can look at them. 
Austin: That’d be perfect. 
Janine: Ok. 
Austin: Where- where is it?
Janine: Hang on, I’m- I gotta- 
Austin: [light laugh] Oh. 
Janine: They’re in the Cloud, so I gotta- [light laugh] 
Austin: Oh, ok.
Ali: Sword Cloud. 
Austin: Sword Cloud. 
Janine: [quietly] Sword Cloud. 
Dre: Sword Cloud. [Ali snorts laughter] 
Austin: Sword Cloud? [light laugh]
Art: Uh oh. Do you ever feel like we just traveled back in time and invited Final Fantasy VII? [Austin laughs] Um…
Austin: Hadrian, do you have insight here since it’s your god... was your god? Is your god? Is a god. 
Art: Is… 
Austin: Is a friend?
Art: Is my god friend. [Austin laughs hard] Uh…
Austin: Oh! Is that what it is? Ok! [laughing] Hadrian wants everyone to meet his GF. His god-friend. 
Ali: Mm. 
Dre: [sighs] God. 
Art: I mean we could really like, throw this whole thing for a loop by picking a couple of these. Like, this one that looks like a fuckin’ meat cleaver?
Austin: We- Ok. 
Art: It really-
Austin: We know Hadrian didn’t make- er, [laughs] Samothes didn’t make a meat- [laughing throughout] ‘This is fine. The sword, if my son kills me with it, will fill the Heat and the Dark with the Breath and Love of Ingenuity Alive. This meat cleaver.’ [Austin and Art laugh]
Art: And he was like, ‘He’s gonna have to [laughs] fuck up.’
Austin: Oh yeah, those are good swords. Ok, here’s a thought. Second photo. Um… second photo, far right. There’s this thing with like-
Art: Mm. 
Austin: Do you see how it’s like… [sighs] Is that- Janine, you saw this sword in person, right? The one that says seven-two-one-six? Top, far-right. Is that… What is the material at the- at the- the hilt? At the top of the hilt? The- like, the guard? And then at the bottom?
Art: Pommel?
Austin: The pommel. Isn ‘t the pommel the bottom?
Janine: The pommel is the big, round part. 
Austin: The big, round part at the-
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah. We’re looking at this sword. It’s-
Janine: The part that looks like the top of a pepper grinder. 
Austin: Yes, so the pommel and then the kind of cross guard. What are- what is that made of?
Janine: Um, it looks like it is… inlaid gold- Like, gold inlaid into maybe material similar to the middle sword. 
Austin: Mm. Ok. Um-
Janine: But you get kind of like a cloisonné effect. Is that what it’s called? I don’t know. 
Austin: Fwoo- I- What? I don’t know what you just said. 
Janine: It’s a-
Austin: I would love to. 
Janine: It’s fine. 
Austin: No, tell me what that word is. 
Janine: Cloisonné is like, when you see um… I think you see it a lot in like, lacquered kind of boxes, but it’s when you get like, uh… Er not lacquered- it’s enameled. 
Austin: Can you spell this effect? Can you spell this word?
Janine: Yes. C-L-O-I-S-O-N-N-E. Cloisonné, technically, yeah. 
Austin: Ok. [reading wikipedia] ‘An ancient technique for decorating metalwork objects.’ Um, ok. 
Janine: It’s like, gold and enamel that you inlay-
Austin: Mm. 
Janine: -in to make these very colorful… Um, you see them on jewelry. Like, little beads. 
Austin: Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Janine: Cloisonné beads are really- are really common still. 
Austin: The thing that I really like about the thing there- Or the thing that it made me think of when I saw it is that like, it almost looks like, not unfinished, but like, if you didn’t- if I didn’t know that was- if I didn’t know that that was gold, I would almost read it as iron. As like… unfinished iron or something. Do you know what I mean? Like, it’s this weird color of- like, the photo doesn’t pick up the details, and it’s hard to read whether or not that’s super fine embellishment or if that’s like, ‘Yeah, the metal looks like this.’ Um, it hasn’t been like, purified. It’s hasn’t been- it hasn’t been refined.
Janine: Like, pig iron?
Austin: Yeah, like pig iron. Exactly. Um, and part of me wonders like, is this sword… closer to what- if like that- the- the kind of embellishments on it and like, the- the pommel and the crossguard and stuff, look like the sort of iron that Samothes would have worked with when he made the sun, right? Like, maybe it’s embellished to look like that actually, but- but a degree to which it’s like- not to bite off of Last Crusade, you know what I mean? But there is some sort of- there is some sort of like, familiarity with that simplicity- with that like, ‘Yeah, this is the sword that Samothes would make.’ 
Samothes would not have made a sword that is covered in jewels and embellishments. Or he might have to make a point, right? But in his- his vision of like, what is good, that version of Samothes specifically was like, utility and function and like- and maybe even history in the sense of like, what that early type of iron would look like. So, maybe it’s something like that on the embellishments. And then a long, straight blade. Like you said, a Western blade with- with um, maybe some additional actual embellishments around the actual hilt, like where you hold it. Anyway, it’s glowing, and you all look great in the light. And you, Hella and Adaire, slam that into this lightning and feel like, resistance. I don’t know what it feels like to slam a sword into lightning, but this feels like slamming a sword into something that it’s like, cutting into, but like, you can’t quite- It’s like putting a sword into very stiff like… it’s not like wood cause there’s give. Like Jell-O? Or something? Do you know what I mean?
Janine: I’ve never slammed a sword into Jell-O, so- 
Austin: Have you ever… 
Janine: -I don’t at all know. 
Austin: Like clay is what it feels like. It feels like you’re pushing a sword into clay. 
Janine: Ok. 
Austin: Um, Throndir, yes. It does, unfortunately… ignore armor. Um, you can also, Adaire and Hella, feel that there is like, energy pouring into you from this thing in a way that’s a little scary. You don’t take any damage this turn. You will probably take damage as you do this again. 
Ali: [breathes deep] Ok. So, we’re stabbing into goo. [Austin and Janine laugh]
Austin: Uh huh. Clay is I think the best analogy. 
Ali: Yes. Yeah. 
Austin: Like think about like, stiff clay like, that you can push, but like, yeah, there is resistance there. So… that ain’t great. Um… Hadrian, the star is now facing away from- You don’t have a backstab move, but you can definitely do damage here to this star. 
[2:00:00]
Art: I mean o- ok. I’m- Are we in danger of killing it? [laughs] 
Austin: Sure. Yeah. You- Is your plan not to kill this star?
Art: No, I- I will. I just didn’t- I thought that the star was wasting my time. 
Austin: Oh. No. 
Art: Um-
Janine: You did half the dam- you did more than half the damage it would have taken to kill that dragon.
Austin: Mhm. You did a lot of damage there, again. [light laugh] 
Art: Um, I mean I’m al-
Janine: It’s possible it’s as strong as a dragon, but-
Art: I’ll deal damage again, but like, my- my point is I’m tryin’ to like just move- I’m tryin’ to like, move it. Just wanting to like, get-
Austin: [over Art] Do you want to do that same thing again… here?
Art: Yeah, I guess. 
Austin: Um… 
Art: So, I’ll spend another Payback.
Austin: Unless you have something else you can do with Payback which, you know… 
Art: I can add damage. 
Austin: You know, can you only spend one at a time?
Art: It doesn’t say that. 
Austin: Ooo. 
Art: Alright, so I’ll- I’ll try to do both. I’ll try to catch it off guard-
Austin: Uh huh.
Art: -and do 1d6 extra.
Austin: Give me that roll.
Art: Oh, I guess I should- I should not spend the second one until-
Austin: Yeah, until you-
Art: -I successfully hit. 
Austin: Well, there’s an eleven. There you go. 
Art: Alright. So, I’ll do both extra d6’s. 
Austin: There’s a lot of damage that could be done here. [light laugh] 
Art: Yeah. 
Austin: Are you also Shield Bashing?
Art: Oh, I guess so. This is just like, a full-on- This is just like- this is like, the- you know like, when someone like, in like a cartoon will attack by like, swinging their arms in a windmill?
Austin: [laughs] Uh huh. Yes. So, this is-
Art: It’s this kind of thing. 
Austin: You’re base d10 plus 2d6… plus 3d6?
Art: Plus 1d6, yeah. 
Austin: Jesus. That’s fif-
Art: And I roll a one, a two, and a three on it. [Austin laughs hard]
Austin: And a nine. 
Art: And a nine. 
Austin: And it’s forceful. That’s a huge, important thing here. 
Art: Yeah, it’s- it’s forceful. 
Austin: I think that you fuckin’ do a combo to this thing. Like, sword, shield, sword, sword, and then how do you remove it from this floating forge in- in the middle of this volcano and send it tumbling into the- into the magma below?
Art: I mean I think it is- it’s the like- it’s the panic and the chao- and like, the chaos in Hadrian’s attack here-
Austin: Mhm. 
Art: -is that like, it looks like he’ll just go with it, right?
Austin: Right. 
Art: Like… like, he’s- he’s like, wrapped it up. He’s like, stabbing it and like, pushing. And then like, at the- at like, the last moment realizes they’re both about to like, tumble off uh… like, uh like, Sherlock and Moriarty. 
Austin: Mhm. 
Art: And I think Hadrian like… I don’t even know if this is possible, but like, stabs his sword- tried to stab his sword just into the ground- 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. 
Art: -and hang on like that. And like, maybe like, feet dangling off the edge and everything. And the- the star just- just doesn’t-
Austin: Just tumbles away. 
Art: -have the wherewithal. Yeah.
Austin: Yeah. Kodiak and Barbelo immediately run over to try to help pull you up. [laughs] Um, unless Throndir and Adaire say no, in which case I have to say no, and they- [Janine laughs] I do what they do. 
Dre: Yeah, no. 
Janine: No, I changed my bond with Hadrian, so now-
Austin: It’s true. It’s true.
Janine: Now we’re good. [Ali laughs]
Austin: Alright. In this moment-
Art: [amused and laughing] Your previous bond wasn’t ‘I’ll let him fall off a cliff.’
Austin: [laughing hard] To his death!
Janine: My previous bond was ‘My dog will never help Hadrian ever.’ [Janine and Austin laugh] So-
Austin: Um, at this point, Hella, Adaire, and Throndir, if you want to add, you can all do damage dice as you shove this sword- try to breach through the heart of this lightning.
Janine: I would- [sighs] I’m on board. 
Ali: Yeah. 
Dre: Sure. 
Austin: Yeah, fuck it, right?
Janine: Both hands in.
Austin: Mhm. 
Ali: I-
Janine: We’re here. 
Ali: Wh- [laughs] While we have this second-
Austin: Yes?
Ali: I do- I do want to like, describe- Cause I think that there is like, a moment in Hella where she’s like, trying to take a- the most of the brunt of the damage that she thinks is coming. 
Austin: That’s- Yeah. 
Ali: Um, like, when I imagine this, I imagine like, Adaire stabbing down, and then like, Hella behind her with like, her back- her- her chest to Adaire’s back, right?
Austin: Mhm.
Ali: Um, so yeah. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: It’s sick. It’s great. Um- [laughing] I’m gonna roll my damage now.
Austin: Hell yeah. Give me- Everyone give me damage. 
Art: We did this right for narrative, but we did this really wrong uh- [Janine and Ali laugh] mechanically. 
Janine: I like that Hella’s first damage roll was so bad, and this one was incredibly good, and mine was the terrible one. 
Austin: Uh huh. Each of you take fifteen damage. 
Ali: [laughs] Oh.
Art: Holy shit! 
Ali: Wait. 
Janine: I am so glad that in my last level, I took one point in Constitution. [laughs]
Austin: This ignores armor. This is like-
Ali: Can I….
Dre: That’s cool. I’m at three. It’s fine. 
Janine: I’m at one. [Austin laughs lightly] That’s why I’m glad I took that one. 
Ali: No, you’re not. No, you’re not. No, you’re not. [laughs] 
Janine: I’m at- Yeah?
Ali: I’m going to spend my two Peace um, [reading] ‘when me or an ally takes damage to call upon my deity who intervenes at the appropriate manifestation:’
Austin: Uh huh. 
Ali: ‘-a gust of wind, a lucky slip, a burst of light to negate the damage.’
Austin: I- Fuck it. 
Ali: Cause you’re not taking-
Austin: This negates it for the whole crew. 
Ali: [quietly laughing] Ok. 
Austin: I think like, the lightning moves through you all, and the pearls like, fol- like, appear as it would move through you, and so there’s just like, strings of pearls covering all of you.
Janine: This is just the most Sailor Moon ass shit at this point. [Art laughs]
Austin: Yeah, it’s great. 
Ali: Mhm.
Austin: And then… [Art laughs] the sword breaches the lightning. And I’m real curious about what this group of people, on this call, think the- I need an exact quote here, this is very important- um, what you think… the Breath and Unity of Ingenuity Alive looks like- er what that means to you. 
Art: Probably has like, gears on it. 
Austin: [defeated] Why are you like this? [Art laughs] Why did you make it steampunk immediately? Um… I- I have suggestions here, but I am super curious.
Dre: Oh, I- I know what it is.
Art: A watch has gear- has gears, and that’s not steam- A watch isn’t steampunk.
Dre: I know what it is for Throndir. 
Austin: [over Dre, replying to Art] A watch is the mo- What is it for Throndir?
Dre: It’s um… all the stories that um… oh, was- was it Gnik was the goblin?
Austin: Yeah. [over Dre] Gnik with a ‘G’.
Dre: That we met like, all the way back in Winter?
Austin: Yeah. 
Dre: Yeah. Um, like all the stories that Gnik had told Throndir of like, how the goblins and the snow elves used to be when they lived together. 
Austin: Mhm. 
Dre: Like just start playing in front of him like a movie. 
Austin: Mm. So like, this like, feeling of unity and like-
Dre: Mhm. 
Austin: Like difference. Like, it was not like, ‘We were all snow elves once,’ it was like, ‘Yeah, we all used to be together. Like, we used to hang out. It was a- things were fine.’ Um, that’s a good touchstone. Any other touchstones for what the Breath and *Love of Ingenuity Alive look like? 									(*Austin means Unity)
Ali: Yeah, I mean I feel like if we’re talking about like, individual hits here-
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: -I think there’s a moment of Hella where it’s like, really coming to accept her fears. Um… it’s kind of neat- like, when I neat, I mean like, too-
Austin: Like, simple? Like, clean?
Ali: Clean, yeah. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Ali: But I think that there’s a- you know, ingenuity is something that she… rejected for all of her life, um, and have only in the- you know, the past whatever has come around to like, seeing you know… that there’s- you know, there’s value in- in difference and in um… maintaining um… creativity- 
Austin: Right. Right. 
Ali: -and- and you know, diversity in that way, right?
Austin: Hella Varal, you know, ‘kill something rather than understand it’-
Ali: Right, yeah. 
Austin: -is the literal opposite of ingenuity, right? Is literally the opposite of newness. [Ali laughs] And now is like… You’ve surrounded yourself by clever people, and you literally are dating two of them. [light laugh] So… [Ali cackles] Adaire. [Ali exhales] And the reason- I want-
Janine: I’m having trouble… 
Austin: Go ahead. 
Janine: Sorry, what were you gonna say?
Austin: I was gonna say the reason I’m asking this is because like, the first sword- When- when Samothes made the sword that Ephrim now has, the plan was he was gonna get killed by Maelgwyn with it. And it would release the Breath of- of- The Breath and Love of Ingenuity Alive. Because that was like, ‘Ingenuity Alive’ is Samothes. There was like, a strange love involved because of the parental connection there. And the Breath is like, the thing that is- that is you know, common here, right? It has continued to be part of this sword- that it’s releasing this notion of like, [deep exhaled breath] ‘fwoooo’ out into the world. Which is a weird thing- which is basically stabbing the sky, I know. [light laugh; clears throat] 
The… The second- the thing that actually happens with that sword is, Ephrim kills Mael- Maleothes- Maelgwyn with it, and given their different relationship, given who is holding the blade and- and what’s important from him- from Ephrim? Given who is being killed, which is Maelgwyn and in kind of the worst state, um, and given the kind of situation and where it happens and all that, it becomes- it releases the Breath and Power of Ingenuity Alive. 
But given everything about what this sword is, the way it’s built to counter the starstuff, which is this kind of totalizing force- this thing that kind of reduces everyone to raw material- um, reduces everything to raw material and instead you’re kind of standing up against it. Given the fact that y’all have all just like, gone through this big journey together, and you know, you’re coming still off that high- that high win against that dragon where you were all kind of unified around it. And then- and then in general, just like, the idea of like… you are standing together, but you’re still kind of- have your individuality. 
This is the Breath of- of- the Breath and Unity of Ingenuity Alive. The sense that like, things are together, but they are still distinct. So, if that helps at all, I think that’s probably- I know, that’s like, a lot, but maybe that specifically is the- What- what would make you think of that? Or what would- what would that bring to your mind?
Janine: My- I… Is it ok if it’s a sound?
Austin: Yeah, absolutely.
Janine: Cause the thing I think it would be for Adaire is like… It’s like a transitional sound- it’s like- it’s like, two sounds that kind of- one becomes the other. And I think the first sound is like, you know those- they get used in media a lot where it’s like, a jacket with pockets, and each pocket’s been rigged with a bell. Um, and you use it to learn how to pick pockets, basically. 
Austin: Oh. Yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Janine: Cause you want to be able to pick the pocket without ringing the bell. 
Austin: Yes. 
Janine: So, I think it’s the sound of those bells, but then it transitions into the sound of like, a coin purse being emptied out on a table. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Janine: Like, between a group of people. 
Austin: Mhm. 
Janine: So, it’s like, this- this sort of ringing of this bell and then these coins sort of clattering on a table, and everyone sort of taking their cut. 
Austin: Yeah. Hadrian, do you… Do you like, climb back up and go over and put your hand on theirs- on this fuckin’ sword?
Art: Yeah, yeah. Of course.
Austin: Ok. 
Art: And the- the image I have for Hadrian here is um… the- is watching Benjamin untangle a fishing line for the first time. 
Austin: [exhales] Um… and so I think what happens actually kind of combines all of those feelings of ‘Unity,’ and- and ‘Ingenuity’ together, which is to say, a weird mix of all of your different perspectives and histories along with this place’s history. But I think the first and most direct thing that we see is actually the thing Hadrian just said. The kind of untangling. Um, the lightning, which is you know, has crashed all through Marielda, it- it begins to untangle a little bit. That network directly above the volcano- that huge mesh of lightning- kind of like… it slowly unravels and begins to almost float downwards. Like, landing on the side of the volcano softly. As if you’ve thrown up a roll of toilet paper, you know, or streamers or something. 
And it’s as it’s falling, it’s blooming. You know, from where you’ve driven the sword into this thing, a green and brown and pink and red kind of take over the lightning- not just here. And maybe we see a wide-shot of this, but it seems like it’s happening everywhere. Um, and- you know, I think there’s a bit of a montage here. I think it’s like, you are leaving this place. You’re running back out. The whole- You feel the ground shake beneath you. As this is happening, because it’s not just that some of it’s falling lightly, some of it is actually kind of growing even- even bigger. Some of it’s connected to the plants of the Spring that have already existed. 
There is a- As you kind of come out the side of the volcano and try to find uh, Luiz, who has the boat to take you back to the bigger boat so that you can get the fuck out of here along with as many people as they could all save together, um, you see that you know, right in the middle of Marielda, where Samot’s tower once stood and where it had already been damaged is now completely destroyed as a new branch has- has taken over there. There’s a huge kind of curling tree branch there. And the ground continues to shake as you get on this boat and begin to leave. It is beautiful, but it’s frightening. 
[Jack de Quidt’s “Something” begins playing] 
And I think that there’s a moment, maybe when you’re getting on the bigger boat that- that you all set up- the one that Throndir found- where you can like, look out and see to the north across the coastline, and this is happening everywhere. And I don’t know that you know the repercussions yet, but they are pretty big. And we’ll get to that soon.
