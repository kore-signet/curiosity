Transcriber: Cole

Ali: Hi, everyone. It’s Ali here. I’m just gonna make a couple of quick announcements. The first is that today’s episode is going to be delayed. Apologies, but there’s, you know, just some travel stuff going on, and we’re just gonna take a little bit of extra time to like, perfect this next episode because it’s uh… a little bit of a doozie. [lightly laughs] So, it’ll either release tomorrow or some time on Saturday. But definitely by- by this weekend. Um, but yeah, just, you know, hold tight. Enjoy it when it comes out. You will. It’s good. Uh… ok. 

The second announcement is that we did release our merchandise over on fangamer.com. You can just go over there and search Friends at the Table, and there’s stuff of our show that you can buy. [light laughing] If- it you weren’t online Tuesday morning at a very specific time, you missed the window to actually buy… some… cause it sold out im- immediately. Um… that’s a thing that happened. [laughs] But you can now go to fangamer.com and preorder your Friends at the Table merchandise because… if- if you want it, they’ll print one for you. [laughs] So, yeah. Head over there. We have a bunch of really great stuff. 

The first is a- a COUNTER/Weight shirt designed by Conner Fawcett over at thebadbucket on twitter.com. And it’s like, so cool and comfortable. It’s like, a navy shirt and like, a pink illustration of like, the Chime’s mechs. And like, it just looks really cool, and it comes with a Lazer Ted sticker, and it comes in like, a great size range. And… [exhales] it’s pretty, and I really like it. [laughs] 

The- the second is a Marielda map illustrated by Natalie Riess over Snarlbear on twitter.com. And it’s just- the quality- the print of the- is amazing. The quality of the- the artwork is like, phenomenal. It’s like, this just amazing watercolor of Marielda. Um, it’s beautiful. 

Our third item, which is actually like, for real in stock and not just on for preorder, um, [laughs] is a… Oh, god, the happened, huh? Um, is a Golden Lance badge featuring everybody’s favorite dog. Kodiak, the dog. It’s- it’s very adorable, and like, the perfect size for just putting on like, a- you know, your collar or a bag or like, a pinboard or whatever. And you know, it’s a great way to just represent to the world that either this is my… favorite actual play podcast dog or my favorite actual play podcast weird police force or my favorite actual play podcast hook-up scene. It’s- [laughs] it’s a great- it’s great, and you should have it. And I love it. And it’s great. 

Um… [laughs] It was designed by Laura Verdin who is with fangamer and also helped us with a bunch of the like, backend merch stuff and was such a great help. So, thank you to Laura, and also thank you to Jami Lynne who also helped us out with this and was a dream to work with. You can find her at cloversealife on twitter.com. Support her music. If you’re in the Seattle area, go see her show at the end of the month. 

Speaking of live shows, Friends at the Table is going to GenCon. Tickets for our show go on sale Sunday, May 19th. This Sunday. This coming Sunday, May 19th, at twelve noon eastern standard time. Um, I don’t wanna… I don’t wanna unnecessarily… give- make anyone nervous about this… um… [lightly laughs] but- but we… we didn’t expect the response to our merch. Uh, I don’t think fangamer did. Um, we wou- [laughs] we wouldn’t expect that response to these tickets, but um… it’s possible that our power level has been underestimated. We have a hundred and fifty of those tickets. Maybe we can fill that room. Um, I… if you’re- it you’re going to GenCon just for us, I would say to buy those tickets on Sunday at noon. 

Tickets for the show itself are twelve dollars. GenCon has like, a whole wishlist system where you can like, setup all of the stuff that you want to go to and… you know, buy all of the tickets for the stuff at once. They- they just did like, a- an explainer on twitch.com. I’m gonna link that in this post as well as the information for the event itself, as well as GenCon and as well as the fangamer stuff cause we might as well. But yeah, oh my god. I’m really excited for the GenCon show. It is going to be Austin, Dre, Sylvia, Keith, and Art. They’re gonna be playing Blades in the Dark. It’s gonna be like, a whole Marielda thing. It’s very exciting. I’m gonna be there to sell merchandise or at least I… Mmm… It’s fine. I… [laughs] With the- with the fangamer restocks, I- I believe that I will still have merchandise to sell there. And if I don’t have the fangamer merchandise to sell, I’ll- I’ll still… have something to sell you is what I am free to say at this moment. 

So, yeah. Come to GenCon. Come see us. I’m very excited. I hope everybody else is excited, too. [laughing] I hope the ticket sales go smoothly. But again, I- If you’re hearing this now, you have time to- to figure that out and set up a wishlist and, you know… we’ll- you know- we’ll- we’ll, you know- we’ll see what happens. Um, ok. That’s- that’s all from me right now. So, until tomorrow or until this episode comes out, you know, enjoy. Have fun. Live your life. Have a good day. Have a good night. Thank you so much for listening… Um… ok. Bye!
