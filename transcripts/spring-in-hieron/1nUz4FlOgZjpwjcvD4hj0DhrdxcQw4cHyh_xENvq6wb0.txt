SPRING IN HIERON 22: BETTER EVERY TIME
Transcriber Cole
(Recap)
Art (as Hadrian): Sunder thinks there could be a solution. But not right away. And that it’s dangerous to have Benjamin here while they figure out a solution. Arrell might’ve-
Austin (as Rosana): It’s dangerous to have Benjamin here? This is his home.
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah, uh huh. I know.
Austin (as Rosana): Don’t ‘yeah, uh huh’- Ok.
Art (as Hadrian): I know that it’s bad.
Austin (as Rosana): We’re not sending our son away somewhere else where Arrell can menace him.
---
Austin: Fero, you find a body, not too far from the like- I’d say, we’re gonna go another day ahead at this moment, but like a day before that, you find a body that has been hung up in a bunch of vines and killed, actively.
---
Austin: So everybody else, you’ve made camp, and several hours later, Hadrian is not back. I think Throndir, you come back having figured out what the next direction is for y’all to go. And when you get back, Hadrian is gone.
---
Austin: We get the shot of Fero um, you and Throndir now see two of these boars that are made up of bark and leaves --- in the woods as they- they are like, coming closer and closer to Hadrian, and like, stomping their feet and getting ready to charge. And behind- in front of them, you see Hadrian who is like, ‘I know where I’m goin’.’
Keith: Do their- In the snorting, can I- I can understand the snorting?
Austin: Yeah, yeah. Um, and I- Here’s the thing that’s wild. You hear 2 voices. From them you mostly hear like, [in a low, gruff voice] ‘Grow. Grow. Grow. Grow. Consume. Grow. Grow.’ And then you hear another voice that’s sort of like, placating- or not placating them, but kind of like, directing them and- and like pet- it’s almost like a- a voice that’s like, ‘Yep, grow and consume. Yep, just go ahead and eat that man.’
---
Austin: It’s like, y’all in the back, the boars- now the vines are in front of the boars, as if they are like a curtain the boars will pass through, but then you’ll have to deal with the curtain. Uh, but Hadrian is now safe. And a dog is there and is like, barking all around. [laughs] Hadrian, this dog is barkin’ wild. Just barkin’ all over the damn place.
---
Austin: So, I think the thing that actually happens here is like, as you fire it, it like um- You- you go for the headshot because yeah, duh. You’re a gamer. Um, and it bounces off of and as it’s like turning, it like- you hit it off angle, off of the boar’s tusks which almost take like a metallic glowing sheen on them when you- when your blast fires out and hits them.
---
Austin: At this point, by the way, Ephrim, you’ve heard a gunshot in the distance.
Sylvia: Yeah. I’m- I heard a gunshot from the direction that this flower is pointing at.
Austin: Yep. Yep.
Sylvia: Um, I think I might start heading that way and leave Marigold and Highwater here.
Austin: Um- Benjamin is like,
Austin (as Benjamin): Is my dad ok?
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Your dad’s- [sighs] Your dad’s really strong. And Fero and Throndir are out with him. I’m just gonna go check to make sure. We’ll be back soon, ok?
Austin (as Benjamin): Let me come with you.
Sylvia (as Ephrim): [pause] I promised him I wouldn’t do that.
Austin (as Benjamin): I can help.
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Benjamin. [sighs]
Austin: Rosana’s like,
Austin (as Rosana): Benjamin.
Sylvia (as Ephrim): You need to listen to your parents.
Austin (as Benjamin): I don’t need to listen to- I’m a- I’m an adult. I can do what I- [sighs] Come on.
Sylvia (as Ephrim): [sighs]
Austin (as Benjamin): You know I’m ca- [sighs] I’m not gonna get any better at anything just sitting around at a campfire with some retainers. No offense, Retainers.
Austin: And they’re like,
Austin (as unspecified retainer): Oh yeah. No offense. [Art laughs]
Sylvia: Um… hold on. I want to just see if I have anything in my inventory I can give him to help him protect himself.
Austin: Hmm.
Sylvia: Um… Damn. Ok. No. I thought I bought a shield, but I didn’t. [Austin laughs] Should have done that. Um, I think I meant to do that like a season ago. [laughs]
Austin: Yeah.
Sylvia: Alright, um-
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Two rules if you come with me. You [exhales] always stay behind me, and when we find the others, you don’t leave our sight. Cause it is so- your dad got lost in here, and I- Ok. Between you and me, I know you’re not- you’re kind of smarter than him. [Austin and Dre laugh] But it’s still very dangerous.
Art: Hey, I’m 9 smart. [Austin laughs]
Sylvia: Sure are, buddy. [Dre laughs]
Austin: God. Great.
Art: On an inexplicable scale of 1 to 18, I’m a 9. [laughs]
Austin: Perfect. Um-
Sylvia (as Ephrim): At the first sign of trouble, we’re coming back. Like, not the first sign of- If things get hairy, we’re coming back here, ok?
Austin: He’s like,
Austin (as Benjamin): Fine.
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Look. I know both your mom and your dad, and I don’t want them killing me if something bad happens to you.
Austin: Rosana’s like,
Austin (as Rosana): You be careful. And listen to whatever Ephrim says. And then your dad if you find him.
(End Recap)
Austin: Um, sorry I just really need a good token here for Benjamin. This cocky wizard is funny, but I don’t think it’s Benjamin. [light laugh] [Keith, Sylvia, and Dre laugh hard] 
Art: On the other hand…
Austin: Ugh, it’s so funny though. 
Keith: ‘I’m grown up now.’ [Sylvia laughs]
Austin: ‘I’m big. I’m real big.’
Sylvia: ‘Look at my cool stick.’ [Austin laughs lightly]
Keith: ‘Look at this gross stuff I found.’ [Austin, Dre, and Keith laugh again]
Austin: Oh boy. He uses- could be this guy. [laughing] This dreadlock-having Benjamin. 
Art: I mean, that’s not terrible. 
Keith: Honestly, split the difference between these two. 
Austin: Yeah. Right? In between these two is Benjamin, right?
Art: Yeah. Uh huh. 
Austin: Boom. [laughs] 
Dre: [laughs] Nailed it. 
Austin: I’m gonna use this one with dreadlocks. This is happenin’
Dre: Fu~sion. [Austin, Keith, and Sylvia laugh] 
Austin: Uh, alright. Um, so y’all just start runnin’ up pa- north through the area that- that Hadrian has cleared out. Fero, you are-
Keith: Hey. 
Austin: You are like a bird. You want to fly away. What um-
Keith: Uh hm. Uh, arguably not like a bird. 
Austin: Oh, right. True. Like a sprangaroo puma. [Keith laughs] Sprangaruma.
Keith: [simultaneously] Sprangaruma. [Sylvia laughs]
Austin: Sprangaruma! It’s right there! [laughs] Um, [coughs] So, I think I’m gonna give you the ability to track those things before from that successful past roll instead of making you re-Discern Realities here just to find the person. 
Keith: Ok. 
Austin: But I- but I do think there is difficulty here because like, you’re flying.
Keith: Well, I can hear them. 
Austin: Totally. That helps. But there’s tree cover between the two of you now. Right?
Keith: Uh hm. Yeah. 
Austin: Cause you’re like a big flying thing. So, what I’m gonna do is say like, I think it’s a minus one forward on this dive bomb. But that cancels with the plus one forward from the attack, so just a regular attack roll. 
Keith: Ok. 
Austin: You can use the guidance of like, having succeeded at that Discern Realities before and from you being able to hear it. But like, not being able to look down past these trees and see easily where this thing is, is tough. Um, but so yeah-
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Give me a- It sounds like you’re gonna give a- give me a Hack and Slash. 
Keith: Give a Hack and Slaaaaash. There we go. There it is. 
Austin: That is an 8. Ok. 
Keith: Yes. 
Austin: So, you break through the- the uh, tree cover. You break through the canopy, slam into the ground with your claws out and hit and briefly pin down a humanoid-looking figure that is three times as tall as you. I’d say they’re probably like-
Keith: Not that hard. 
Austin: Uh, no, but like, what are you? 3 feet tall? 4 feet? 3 feet tall?
Keith: I actually think I’m canonically pretty tall. 
Austin: Right. 
Keith: I think like 4’2’’ or something like that.
Austin: Yeah, so this thing is like over- is like, 11 feet tall. They are- they are like, 11 feet tall, made of wood, uh wood and bark and uh, and plant life… um, like- like um, flowering- uh, budding flowers and leaves. Leaves was the word I was having trouble finding. Um, and is- is kind of to the north, past this kind of pseudo-clearing that you found, and is- It has like a number of vines up and around them and like, going out into the woods basically, all around them. Um, go ahead and do your damage, but because you got an 8, they’re also gonna do their damage to you. 
Keith: Alright. I am a- a dangerous animal. So, I use that roll. 
Austin: Yes, you do. 
Keith: 8.
Austin: Nice. 
Art: Nice. 
Keith: I’m doin’ a lot of damage.
Austin: Doin’ a lot of damage out here.
Keith: Almost all of us are doing a lot of damage. 
Austin: Almost. [Keith laughs] Let’s use this one. This one’s- wait, did it not go? Where did it- not go for? Come on. 
Keith: Specifically trying to target those vines, too. 
Austin: Uh, well, so- Oh, on the body, you mean. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Boom. Um, they are gonna do back- [thinking noises] chu-chu-chu So, this is a worse of- this is like, roll 2d8 and take the lower one. So, I’m gonna roll 2d8 and take the lower one, but it’s 2d8, uh-
Keith: Why is that?
Austin: It’s just the way the-the- Oh, wait, Sorry. I’m looking at the wrong creature. That’s- the vines do 2d8, take the lower one. Uh- oh wait, not- I’m wrong- I’m not wrong. 
Art: Is that better than 1d8 or worse? I guess it’s worse than 1d8. 
Austin: Worse. It’s worse than 1d8. Uh, like this because now I’m taking the 1 instead of taking the 5 I just rolled. Um, [someone whistles] so yeah, so not so bad here. The- your- your claws-
Keith: My armor deflects that. 
Austin: Yeah, your armor deflects that 1 super easily. The um, claws dig in really sharply, and you hear them go like- ah, you know I think it’s like hearing- you hear the- the wood cracking interi- like internally. 
Keith: Hmm. 
Austin: Which is like their version of like, gasping, basically. And then they like- you have them pinned down and then like, vines basically pull them out from under you. And it’s like they’re sliding across the ground and shout out to you in- in the floral speak that you can understand, 
Austin (as unnamed Dryad): Go away. This isn’t yours. Go away. 
Keith (as Fero): What’s not mine?
Austin (as unnamed Dryad): Here. 
Keith (as Fero): Why is it yours?
Austin (as unnamed Dryad): Because I am here. 
Keith (as Fero): Oh, ok. That’s dumb. Ok. Nevermind. Forget that. 
Keith: Can I attack again? What’s going on? [laughs]
Austin: Jeez. Fero needs a fuckin’ dissertation on- on why- [laughing] why someone else deserves to be here. We’re gonna- we’re gonna- Let’s head back to Throndir, who has a boar and these vines between- between him and Hadrian, Kodiak, and the other boar. What are you doin’ Throndir?
Dre: Um, I want to try and um- I guess this would maybe be a Trick Shot, but I want to try and like, cut down these vines. 
Austin: Ok. um, I think- with - with a gun?
Dre: So, we- we- one of the things we talked about was like, the gun has that like, weird pump-handle-
Austin: Yeah, totally. 
Dre: that like, lets it kind of mut- not mut- mutate’s the wrong word- 
Austin: It is. 
Dre: -but whatever, I’m going with it. 
Austin: Modif- like- Yeah.
Dre: Like mutate the- Modify the type of bullet that comes out.
Austin: Yeah. 
Dre: So, maybe like, I’m using that to like, make it more into like a spread like, shotgun style-
Austin: Ok. Sure
Dre: -shot. 
Austin: Um, go ahead and give me a- a Trick Shot then. 
Dre: Uh roll aim. I have 2 aim. 
Keith: Does it morph? Is it morph, the word?
Dre: Maybe. 
Austin: So, this is roll plus aim, right?
Dre: Uh hm.
Austin: What is your aim currently?
Dre: Which I have 2. 
Austin: You have 2. Ok. So, 2d6 + 2. Oof. 
Dre: That's bad. 
Austin: That’s a 6. 
Dre: Uh hm. 
Austin: Yikes. Yikes. Alright. Um, so, you can keep that aim. I’m not gonna reduce that aim yet, uh, because I think the thing that happens is like, you can’t get a shot off quickly enough. This boar is in between you and the vine. And now that you shot once at the boar, the other boar- like this boar is turning around and gonna hit you. The one that’s closest to you is like, interrupting you as you try to take this shot. Which is bad for you because you’re about to get hit by a boar. [light laugh]
Dre: Uh hm. 
Austin: Um, [thinking noises] Da-da-da. As a reminder, they have eight legs and weird, sharp-
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: -tusks. So, don’t get s- don’t get trampled either. Uh, roll-
Art: I don’t know that I needed that reminder, but thanks. 
Austin: Uh hm. 
Keith: What was the snake bit from?
Austin: What? Oh, the- the vine that connects them to this-
Keith: Oh. 
Austin: -thing you’re fighting. 
Keith: They’re thick then. Alright. 
Austin: Y-oh, yeah. They’re big, thick vines. Yeah, totally. Uh, take 3 damage, and that is- that is 3 armor piercing damage. 
Dre: So, it ignores armor?
Austin: It does. 3- it ignores 3 armor, basically. So, if it had done- if it had d- if you have 4 armor, you would still protect 1, you know? Um- or if it had, you know-
Dre: Yeah, but I don’t. I think I have 1 armor. 
Austin: You must have 1 armor. Do you not have 1 armor?
Dre: Cause I’ve g- I think I do, and I just forgot to put it. 
Austin: You must have armor. 
Dre: Yeah, cause I’ve got leather. 
Austin: Ok. Ok. 
Dre: That’s one. Yeah. 
Austin: Makin’ me worried. [light laugh] At this point, this vine that is- that you just shot at and missed is moving back over towards Hadrian. So, like, the- the assassin vine is kind of crawling its way back over there slowly. Hadrian, what are you up to?
Art: What does it feel like to take damage that ignores armor?
Austin: Uh, I think it’s just like punctures the armor- as hard as it can. Do you know what I mean? It basically feels like, ‘Well, fuck. I’m wearing this big, heavy thing. Why?’ [Keith laughs]
Art: So, I- I know it isn’t working?
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: Ok. Great. 
Austin: Um, but as a reminder, it’s piercing the armor. It isn’t ignor- or you’re saying- cause I- what I- Here’s what I’ll say. I think being hit by something that ignores armor like, star stuff, is different than by- by hitting something that pierces armor because pierce- piercing armor is- has a certain degree. But when you’re hit by something that pierces armor, maybe in the, you know, the- the clear uh, sunlight of a new day, you would say, ‘Ah, if only had had more armor on.’ But if your star sword, I suspect you go, ‘There's nothing I could have done to prevent that star sword from killing me.’
Art: Sure. Wha- I guess what I’m- Cause like, shield bash does extra damage-
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: -and gives me a minus armor going forward.
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: But this chews through my armor anyway. Like I’m asking like, does it makes sense fictionally to just start spamming shield bash?
Austin: Yeah, I think that that’s- that’s like, Hadrian’s good at combat, and Hadrian is like, ‘You know what? Fuck it.’ Like, yeah. 
Art: Alright. 
Austin: ‘Let me just go all out. Let me try to win this fight instead of- I can’t- I can’t exchange blows in that way. I have to go for a knockout’ is a good thought.
Art: Alright, so I’m gonna try and hit that same boar, if it’s possible. 
Austin: Go for it. 2d- like, uh, 2d6 + 2, for strength.
Art: Hey! 
Austin: Boom. That’s a 10. God damn. So, you can do your damage, and if you’re doing a shield bash, you can do plus 1d6 damage and take minus 1 armor forward as you kind of leave yourself over extended. You could also choose to do another plus 1d6 damage, if you want to like, exchange blows.
[15:00]
Art: I do not. These things are rough. 
Austin: Yeah. Uh, go ahead and give me then the uh, the- your damage. Which is what?
Art: What is-
Austin: 1d8? 1d10? 1d10 plus 1d6. 
Art: Great. 
Austin: That is- [laughs] low damage, all said. Given those numbers. That is a 7, but it is enough in- oh wait, uh, here’s a question. The 1- is it- Hmm. Does- If it’s a- If that 1d6 comes from a shield bash, that doesn’t get through their armor. 
Art: Oh. 
Austin: Right? 
Art: Hm. 
Austin: Cause like, the star stuff is definitely enough to- Like, the star stuff sword pierce- Like ignores armor, but the shield doesn’t ignore armor. 
Art: Sure. 
Austin: So, you almost had this thing. I thought you had it. Um, you hit it with the shield and then are able to get another good swipe in with the sword. And it’s hurt. Um, I think it’s hurt to the degree that it’s- it like, circles around this other direction and is near- is trying to get back to the- the forest creature that Fero is fighting uh, and is- is like, trying to back away a little bit. Ephrim and Benjamin, y’all are behind Throndir. You move up enough to see Throndir. 
Sylvia: Alright. Well, I think- I mean-
Austin: Also, Throndir is being hit by a boar. [light laugh]
Sylvia: Yeah, I’m gonna probably draw my sword when I see that boar. Um, and then I might- I think I’m gonna ask Benjamin if he knows any like, 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Do you know combat magic?
Austin (as Benjamin): I- I know a thing or two. 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Ok. 
Sylvia: Um-
Austin: I’m looking up what he knows. One second. [Sylvia laughs] You can keep talking. 
Sylvia: Yeah, I’m just gonna be like, 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Ok, well, I need to help get that thing off Throndir. You try and help from here. And we’ll move forward once we clear that out. 
Austin (as Benjamin): Sounds good. 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Ok. 
Sylvia: I’m gonna go-
Art: It is important to me to know when I am aware that Benjamin is here. 
Austin: Sounds good. I will let you know. Um, yeah, I’m gonna say Benjamin has some first level spells. I don’t think he’s at third level yet, but he’s got- he’s got- he got- I’m lookin” at these first level spells. He can do this shit. 
Keith: He can do magic weapon. 
Austin: This game doesn’t have that, and so he can’t do that. But he can do-
Keith: I have that. 
Austin: -magic-
Keith: I have that. 
Austin: That’s cause you’re a- Oh sorry. You know what? You’re a cleric. You can do magic weapon. 
Keith: Oh. Ok. 
Austin: He’s a wizard. Er he’s not a wizard, but he’s study- Oh, I guess he- he is a wizard. He is the- He- He is studying to become a wizard, so… He’s, you know- he hasn’t said it yet, but as far as this world is concerned, at this point, he is The Wizard. [light laugh] Um-
Keith: There’s not a mage that’s a better ‘the wizard’ than the wizard?
Austin: What do you mean? Uh, there is, but a wizard is different. You know? There’s lots of mages. There’s only one The Wizard. 
Keith: Well, that’s what I mean. But doesn’t the- isn’t the best mage the wizard?
Austin: No, wizards are adventurers. Wizards know a little bit- wizards are more, you know- There are- there are warlocks. There are mages. Wizards are about study and about... I don’t fuckin’ know. He’s The Wizard, ok? [Sylvia laughs] 
Keith: Ok. [laughs] 
Austin: Um, wizards have these specific spells, you know? Is maybe the way to think about it. So, yeah, I think- I think- I’m tryin’ to see like, if there’s something he gives you before you attack. Uh, Ephrim. 
Sylvia: That would be good cause I’m very bad at that now. 
Austin: Oh, are you?
Sylvia: Well, comparatively um- and-
Austin: Hm, oh right. 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: I don’t have my fire anymore-
Austin: Oh. 
Sylvia: -and I have to fight with a sword like everybody else. 
Austin: God. I know what he does. 
Sylvia: Does he- Oh my god. 
Art: He sets you on fire. [laughs] 
Austin: No. [Keith laughs] He says like, 
Austin (as Benjamin): Wait. I- 
Austin: And then he touches you, and he like, lowers his hand, and you disappear. He makes you invisible. 
Art: Oh my god. 
Sylvia: Oh my god. 
Art: Oh my god. 
Sylvia: Uh, I think Ephrim also says, 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Oh my god! [Austin laughs] 
Austin: He goes, 
Austin (as Benjamin): Shh. 
Austin: And then he does it for himself, too. 
Art: Oh my god. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Sylvia: Hmm. 
Art: Why did we let this- Mmm. [Austin and Keith laugh hard] 
Austin: Fantasmo’s been teaching him. He’s been wat- he’s been readin’ them books. 
Art: Yeah. I- I- I- god. 
Austin: 1 8,  - 1 (800)-FANTASMO, you know? He got the- the Encyclopedia Fantasmo shipped to his door.
Art: Yeah, sometimes you just-
Keith: ‘At the first sign of trouble-’ [Austin laughs hard, Dre laughs, too]
Art: Sometimes you’re just really happy that your kid is learning, and you don’t even think about what the curriculum is.
Austin: Uh hm. 
Sylvia: Ok, so now that I’m invisible-
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: -uh, I need to stab this boar that’s att- attacking Throndir, real bad, I think.
Austin: You do. You do. 
Sylvia: Um, so, yeah. Should I just roll Hack and Slash? [laughs] Like, all I think Ephrim is doing is trying-
Austin: No, you- you’re invisible. You’re invisible. 
Sylvia: Oh, so I can just damage it. 
Austin: You can just do damage as established. 
Sylvia: Ok. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: Um, I’m just making sure I have the right damage here for my class really quick.
Austin: Yeah, you’re-
Sylvia: I think I do. I think I’m pretty weak, but I just want to make sure.
Austin: Yeah, I don’t think Barons do it like that anymore, you know?
Sylvia: Yeah. Uh-
Austin: Barons got people to fight for them. They got retainers who you left behind. 
Sylvia: I do. Alright, well I guess I’ll just roll this d6 instead of fumbling through PDFs for-
Austin: Uh, wait, you still have the sword though, right?
Sylvia: I do have the sword, but we never gave the sword any stats other than it’s a close weapon.
Austin: Let’s give the sword- I mean, it’s- we should give that sword some stats real quick, right?
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: Um, tag reference. I would say it is uh, plus 1 damage. It’s- do we have the- yeah, close is right on dam- er on length- er uh, distance rather. Um…I’m tryin’ to think if there’s anything else that really pops out here. What are your stats? Yeah. 
Sylvia: Uh-
Austin: Yeah, the thing is you used to be able to use your constitution to hit things with, right?
Sylvia: I used to- No, it used to be my intelligence that I used for it.
Austin: Oh. Ok. 
Sylvia: And then constitution was what I used to summon the Burning Brand. That’s why they’re my two highest stats. Yeah. 
Austin: Right. That makes sense. And now neither of those is really doin’ it for you, huh?
Sylvia: I mean, they’ve got other uses, just not for killing things. 
Austin: They do. They do. They do. Um, which is interesting. I don’t think it’s precise…. Is it- is it piercing? Is it- hmm… I’m like looking at things you can give to gear, and most of it’s not it, you know?
Sylvia: Yeah. We can just stick with the plus 1 for now-
Austin: Yeah, for now. For now. 
Sylvia: -and if we think of stuff that’s more relevant, you can do it. 
Austin: Yeah, and as always, maybe there’s more there to unlock, you know?
Sylvia: Yeah. Is it- It’s a very magic sword, so… we can-
Austin: It is a very mag- It’s a sun, you know?
Sylvia: Yeah, it’s pretty- we can retcon that with- with reason.
Austin: But it isn’t like a fire sword, you know?
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: It’s a thing that maybe you should study and figure out. Maybe it can become a fire sword. Maybe it can become a stun- a stunning blade, you know?
Sylvia: I would love to have a fire sword again-
Austin: I fuckin’ bet. 
Sylvia: I miss those days. 
Austin: Yeah. Totally. 
Sylvia: Alright. I rolled a 4 on damage without the plus 1. 
Austin: So- so 5 total. 
Sylvia: So, 5 damage total. Yeah. 
Austin: Ok. Most of this kind of like, as you stab it in, it- it- most of it kind of- you can feel the blade not dig into the boar. Um, it turns out, I heard this somewhere, boars are really hard to kill. [light laugh] 
Sylvia: Huh. 
Austin: And of that 5, you only actually do 2 damage. 
Sylvia: Alright. 
Austin: Um, it goes like-
Art: Who keeps telling Austin nature facts?
Austin: Yeah, who could say? It goes like, [foley] ‘Bwaaaarrm’.
Dre: Zoobooks. 
Austin: ‘Bwaaarrrrm’. [Keith laughs] And is makin’ noises, but is not that hurt. Um-
Keith: Fun fact, my uncle was in the TV commercial for Zoobooks that ran for like, 15 years. 
Sylvia: Are you for real?
Dre: Holy shit. 
Keith: Yeah, yeah. 
Austin: Wow. 
Keith: Like I remember him be- He was like, the voice of the commercial, like where- like 'Zoobooks, by the- Here’s- Get all these things from Zoobooks.’ And it aired like-
Art: Residuals or buy out?
Keith: Oh, I have no- I haven’t ask- I could ask. I should ask. Next time we record, I’ll let you know. 
Art: Cause that was either a grip or nothing. 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. Uh-
Keith: Oh, I found it. I just- Zoobooks commercial. It was the first one. 
Austin: What’s he say? Is he the narrator? Who is he?
Keith: No, he’s not- I think he was the narrator in one, but this one he does the ending thing where it’s like, ‘You can call and order the ba-ba-ba-’
Austin: Oh wow. That’s him.
Keith: I’ll find it. Here it is. I’ll- I’ll link it. 
Art: I was tryin’ to think the other day about whether or not I thought the guy who does the opening narration on Law and Order is uh- like did that person get paid once or is that person like, the richest person on earth?
Austin: Like, the guy who goes, ‘Law and Order is a duh-duh-duh-duh-duh’?
Art: Like, yeah. You know, uh- you know in the-
Austin: ‘In the criminal justice system-’
Art: System, yeah. ‘The people are represented by two equally important groups’, you know?
Austin: Law and Order. Steve Zirnkilton. Zirnkilton. Steven Zirnkilton is who does the Law and Order one. 
Art: When you google search him, is he wearing like, a cape or something? [Austin laughs] Or like a turban? Is he like, on a golden throne?
Austin: Uh, no. But he did serve for 8 years uh, in the Maine House of Representatives as a Republican.
Dre: Bummer. 
Austin: Yeah, who could have imagined the guy who does the Law and Order voice- [Sylvia laughs] 
Keith: No, yeah. 
Art: I mean, a job’s a job. 
Austin: A job’s a job…. But-
Keith: I mean, but it’s a good job if you’re a Republican. 
Austin: [laughs] Right. You’re like, ‘Yes.’
Keith: Yes. 
Austin: ‘The criminal justice system does work. It’s definitely not fucked.’ Um, but alright. Fero.
Keith: Hi. 
Austin: This dryad is like, um, [exhales] you can see other vines are like, you know, there’s the ones that you were targeting before, but other ones from nearby are like, moving to replace those broken ones, and the broken ones are shriveling and falling off. 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: And maybe suggests to you that they are capable of healing themselves here. 
Keith: Uh hm. 
Austin: And that that is what’s happening. Which is bad because you would like not to heal so much- 
Keith: Yeah. Not for them to heal.
Austin: Right. Not for them to heal. And I think at this point, they also say like, um, you know, 
Austin (as unnamed Dryad): What right do you have?
Keith (as Fero): I- We just have the right for you to not attack us.
Austin (as unnamed Dryad): Why?
Keith (as Fero):Why not?
Austin (as unnamed Dryad): Things exist and-
Keith (as Fero):Yeah, same. Things exist. Same. 
Austin (as unnamed Dryad): And sometimes they stop. 
Austin: And charges at you. This is- this- there is no- You know how sometimes we say we live in society?
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah, not so much. This dryad does not live in society. This dryad is a society and is happy to eat things. 
Keith: Yeah.
Austin: Why ought there- why ought there be society instead of not society? Give me-
Keith: I got- I mean, that’s the impression I got earlier. 
Austin: Right, totally. Give-
Keith: When they said, ‘you- you can’t be here cause I’m here.’ And then I’m like, ‘Why?’ It’s like, ‘well, cause I already- cause I’m here.’
Austin: Yep. 
Keith: Ok. Yeah. 
Austin: God. 
Art: And just for everyone- so everyone’s clear, Austin’s definition of society is one or more people who eat. 
Austin: [laughs] Yep. [everyone laughs] Yep. When I cook food for my-
Keith: Wait, wait. Does that mean that I’m not part of a society?
Austin: Yeah, unless you’re eating food with somebody. [light laugh] 
Keith: Fer- well, I guess Fero does eat socially. 
Austin: Right. 
Keith: So, that does make sense. 
Austin: Right. Um, the- this dryad is charging you again, and is- like whips two extra vines out to try to like- it actually charges you a little bit, and then comes up short is actually what happens, and then whips out two long, like razor-vines from their ha- from their like, uh, their wrists. Almost like Spiderman webs, and is like, pulling them up and down like whips to try to keep you a little bit at range given your- your big, puma claws. Um-
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: What do you do?
Keith: Um, this is gonna be fun. I- I go for it. I just go for it. 
Austin: Ok. You’re going to take damage whether or not you fail because you’re- if you move in on these vines, they will hit you. So, you can do- you can do the Hack and Slash here-
Keith: Can I get my damage in before I- I get my damage before I take damage, right?
Austin: No, if you- 
Keith: No?
Austin: I’m saying in this case, you can- you could Defy Danger to try to get- to try to get in. So, two things you could do. One, you could just do a Hack and Slash, and I’m telling you that even if you succeed on that Hack and Slash, you will have taken damage from having pushed in through this vine whip situation. Two, you could try to Defy Danger to get around the vine whip, and like, get an angle on them that they have not protected. You know?
Keith: Ok. 
Austin: Um, so either of those. 
Keith: What’s my Defy Danger here?
Austin: You- How are you gonna get around them? It depends.
Keith: Um, I mean, I have the piston arms. I could like, dash to the side like at a 45 degree angle.
Austin: Yeah. Like a [piston shooting foley] ‘Pwoo’ and then charge forward?
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah, that’d be a dex.
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: I’d say that would be a Defy Danger dex. 
Keith: Ok. Yeah. I’m gonna do that
Austin: Alright, give me a Defy Danger dex. 
Keith: 12. 
Austin: Boom. Alright. Now give me that- a regular Hack and Slash. Alright. 
Keith: 8. 
Austin: So, you’re still gonna get hit here cause you rolled an 8, but-
Keith: But this is gonna be fine. 
Austin: -you’re not- you’re not gonna hit- you’re not gonna get hit twice, which is what would have happened if you’d just rolled this. 
Keith: I have a- I have a thing here. So, the first thing that I do is I do my dangerous attack, right?
Austin: Yes. 
Keith: Ok. That’s a 7. 
Austin: Boom. Good hit. 
Keith: And then now what happens?
Austin: Now, they are gonna give you the damage back. Uh-
Keith: Ok. Do it. 
Austin: [thinking noises] ‘chu-chu-chu’ Uh, again this is the worst of these, so 5. Take 5. 
Keith: 5. Ok. This triggers Shed. “When you take damage while shapeshifted, you may choose to revert back to your natural form to negate the damage.” 
Austin: There you go. And now you’re in close and you’re just a halfling. Uh-
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: -and you are-
Keith: Just a halfling. 
Austin: Well,  you know. You’re not- you’re not a sprangaruma, that’s for sure. 
Keith: Right. 
Austin: I just feel like sprangarumas cost a little too much. I want a sprangruma for my house. Keep it clean, but-
Keith: Does it come in generic?
Austin: [laughs] Uh, one second. I have to do this damage the right way. Uh, alright. 
Keith: It’s called a Wallabounce. [Austin laughs] is the uh, generic. 
Austin: Great. [Keith laughs] Good. Um, Hadrian. Actually, no, let’s go back to Throndir. [light laugh] There’s this- there’s still a boar, and now uh, Ephrim is here with the boar and has hit it with a sword. And there’s that. That is what’s happening here. What do you do, Throndir?
Dre: Um, [thinking sounds] chu-chu-chu-chu-chu. Well, now that Ephrim’s here, I think I’m just gonna go try and cut through those vines just using my- my like, knife. 
Austin: Ok. So, you’re gonna get- Here’s- Again, there is this boar between you and the vines. 
Dre: Oh, ok. Then…
Austin: Uh, you can try to get around it, but again, that would be a Defy Danger to like, not get attacked as you try to get around it. 
Dre: Sure. 
Austin: What’s up?
Sylvia: Here’s a question. If this doesn’t go through, could I use the Defend roll to take that attack? Since I’m close to the boar.
Austin: You can do that now. 
Sylvia: Can I do that now?
Austin: You could set up the defense right now. Yes. 
Sylvia: Ok. 
Austin: So, you can go ahead and-
Sylvia: Then I- Maybe I should do that cause that’s um-
Austin: Ok. Yeah, Defend is “when you stand in defense of a person, item, or location under attack. Roll plus CON.” Go ahead and do that now. 
Sylvia: Ok. 
Austin: To set up- cause you get hold to then spend basically. 
Sylvia: Alright. This is a plus 2. 
Austin: It is a plus 2. And that is a 9. 
Sylvia: That’s a 9, so I get 1 hold.
Austin: You get 1 hold, which then you can spend 1 for 1 to redirect an attack from the thing your defending to yourself, half the attack’s effect or damage, open the attacker up to an ally, or deal damage to the attacker equal to your level. 
[30:10]
Sylvia: Um-
Austin: Which you don’t have to do yet. You can do that as-
Sylvia: Yeah. Yeah. 
Austin: Yeah. You’d spend it basically. So Throndir, are you gonna try to get around this boar? Or are you gonna try to fight this boar?
Dre: Nah, I’m just gonna shoot it. I’m just gonna keep fightin’ it. 
Austin: Ok. Give me a Hack and Slash.
Dre: Can I- Uh.
Austin: Are you like, tryin’ to back off and get some- I guess at this point, the thing is like with Ephrim there-
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: -you won’t get like, an attack of opportunity here as you’re trying to use a gun on a boar from close range because Ephrim is also here distracting the boar. So-
Dre: Well, yeah, and I think I’d probably use an opportunity to like, back up.
Austin: Er also, I said Hack and Slash. That’s not true. It’s not Hack and Slash. 
[simultaneously]
Dre: Yeah, it’s Volley, right? 
Austin: It’s Volley. Yeah. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: Did I make you Hack and Slash before? No, you just did damage as established before, right? And then you Trick Shot it. 
Dre: Uh hm.
Austin: So, yeah. We’re good. We’re good. So, yeah, go ahead and give me a Volley. 
Dre: Uh 12. 
Austin: Hell yeah. So, that is- you have a clear shot. Just deal your damage, straight up. Oh my god. 
Dre: Jesus. 
Austin: What is happening, Throndir? That’s a 1. 
Dre: I don’t know. 
Austin: It again like- I think this time it like- it- there is something that happens here that makes you think that maybe these things are smarter than you associate with a boar, which is it actively blocks this blast with it’s tusk. [Dre laughs] It’s like, [boar foley] ‘bwaaarn’ as the bullet just goes off into a tree somewhere else. 
KEITH; Jeez. 
Dre: Here’s the problem. If I had Kodiak here, I’d be getting plus something to my damage. 
Austin: You could call Kodiak back to you. 
Dre: Nah, it’s fine. 
Austin: Alright. Hadrian, there is a- there are vines creeping towards you and a boar in front of you. What are you doing?
Art: That’s a- it’s a different boar. It’s a second boar?
Austin: Different, much har- much more damaged boar. [light laugh] 
Art: Well, the- the boar slinking away only had 1 hit point, right?
Austin: Yes. 
Art: So, that can’t be a less- a more damaged boar. 
Austin: No. That would be dead, yeah.
Art: Um, I think I want to like, pivot away from the vines and try to hit this boar. 
Austin: Ok. Uh-
Art: And will be tryin’ to shield bash. 
Austin: Alright. Give me that shield bash. 
Art: Er not the- not the retreating boar. 
Austin: Oh, the closer boar. The hurt- the non-hurt boar. 
Art: Yeah, the- the- You said the boar was like slinking awa- I’m not gonna like, chase down a fleeing animal.
Austin: Ok. 
Keith: Yeah, what is this Monster Hunter? [Austin laughs] 
Art: Just feels like a waste of everyone’s time and talent. 
Austin: Fair. Uh, alright. Give me a- a Hack and Slash then on this boar that is just invincible. Just a great boar. 
Art: What are you on the boar’s side now? [Keith laughs] 
Austin: I- This boar is doing great. Alright, that’s a Hack and- You do damage and take damage here. You got an 8. 
Art: Alright, I will be also shield bashing. 
Austin: Alright. This boar will be also doing its damage back. [typing] Jesus Christ. [Sylvia laughs lightly] I mean, that still hits cause it pierces armor. That’s a 1. And then you also, the d6? Wait. You did- I think you fucked this up, Art. 
Art: I didn’t roll that. 
Austin: Wait, did you not roll that?
Art: Oh, I know what happened. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Art: Yeah, uh, so that’s my d10 and that’s my d6. 
Austin: Yes. 
Art: So-
Austin: The shield does damage here. 
Art: So does the- the sword pierces. 
Austin: Yeah, so that 1. That 1, but it only does 1, right? Ok.
Art: Yeah, right. That 1 is 1, and the 6 is whatever the 6 is.
Austin: Is 6 minus the boar’s armor. But hey, you’re hittin’ this fuckin’ boar now, for real. Um-
Art: Someone’s gotta. 
Austin: Someone- someone has got to hit this boar. Uh, Hadrian has shown up to hit this boar. And I actually think this the moment, Hadrian, where Benjamin reveals himself, as a staff appears in front of you pointed behind you and blasts the retreating boar and kills it. 
Art: Well-
Keith: Boar dead. 
Art: Boar dead. 
Austin: Boar down. 
Keith: Boar dead.
Austin: Boar down. Uh- [light laugh]
Art: Um- That’s a real deep cut. 
Austin: Uh huh. [laughs] 
Keith: Yeah, it’s a real deep, unrecorded cut. 
Austin: Alright. Um-
Art: Uh, ok, so now I burn with with a righteous anger. 
Keith: Been waiting an hour for that. 
Austin: Who’s that big man? Uh- [Keith and Dre laughs] Wait, why are you burning with righteous anger?
Art: Because there are threats to my loved ones?
Austin: Ah ha. There you go. 
Art: So, I now have 3 payback. 
Austin: Great. 
Keith: Like an IOU?
Art: Yeah.
Austin: Like the Mel Gibson movie?
Art: I have 3 copies [Austin laughs] of the movie Payback that I can give out-
[heavy cross-talking begins]
Austin: Just throw those out. 
Art: -and then- and then people-
Keith: Like, you’re- yeah, looking to get rid of these. [Austin laughs] 
Art: -people feel good feelings towards me because I gave them a movie. 
Austin: Are you like the person who-
Art: When you watch it- it [inaudible]
Austin: -comes in Subway sometimes, like, ‘Hey, I got- I got 3 copies of the Mel Gibson movie, Payback. 3 dollars.’
Keith: Wait, hold on. This is- this is fun. Do you mean Subway sandwich shop? Or subway like the underground train station?
Austin: Both. 
Keith: Because- because yeah, cause I used to buy- or my dad used to buy like, uh-
Austin: Bootleg-
Keith: -blank camera. Bootleg like-
Austin: Yeah. 100% did the same thing. Yup.
Keith: Like, cam- movie theater cam shit from-
Austin: From Subway sandwich shops. 
Keith: -from a guy that hung out in a Subway sandwich shop. 
Austin: 100% yeah. Totally. This is a known thing. This is a thing that happens. If you-
Keith: Wait, is it su- Is it always Subway? Any kind of Subway? [laughs] 
Austin: This has happened to me in 2 states... 3 states and a different country. 
Sylvia: God. 
Austin: New York. New Jersey. California. Ontario. 
Keith: Well, you’ve got to watch Iron Man 2, and it’s not comin’ out on dvd for like, another 4 months. 
Austin: It’s not. And this guy has it right here! 
Keith: He has it right here, and it’s really tough to watch, but-
Austin: Because it’s Iron Man 2, but also- [Sylvia laughs] 
Keith: It’s Iron Man 2, but also because the camera was upside down. Or something.
Austin: [laughs] But it’s ok, you just flip the- the TV. It’s not a big deal. Um, alright. 
Keith: Yeah, you can use Windows Movie Maker to rotate it, and then export it back out of the dvd. 
Austin: Um, meanwhile, I just want to point this out that I think- I think Kodiak is trying to fight this razor uh, blade vine. This assassin vine, but it’s hard to get the bite right cause it’s all the- it’s sharp and so, is just kind of like, keeping it from attacking other people right now. Um, anyway, this- this boar’s dead. What’s that payback actually do for you?
Art: Uh, I get 3 payback. I can spend a payback to act despite pear, fain, or- pain, fear, or doubt. 
Austin: Great. 
Art: Act suddenly with conviction catching your foe off guard. 
Austin: Hm.
Art: “Add plus 1d6 damage and the forceful tag to your next attack. Stand fast, keep your position stance, and course despite what befalls you. Or throw off the effects of being stunned, confused, or enchanted.“
Austin: Hm, good stuff. Um-
Art: Um, and I can also, yeah. Uh hm. 
Austin: Uh, Ephrim?
Sylvia: Yes, hello. 
Austin: Everyone- everyone has surrounded this boar. There are 4 people surrounding this boar. One of them is you. 
Keith (as Fero): [yelling from afar] I’m good up here, by the way! [Austin laughs] 
Art (as Hadrian): Great!
Austin: Uh, did you spend your- oh, you’re back to being a person now-
Sylvia: I haven’t-
Austin: -yeah, uh Fero. 
Sylvia: Yeah, I haven’t spent the thing yet. 
Austin: But yeah, Ephrim, you have what?
Sylvia: Um, I have 1 hold for this Defend thing. 
Austin: Oh, you do. 
Sylvia: But other than that-
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: I have- yeah. Um, yeah, I don’t know if I can- I’m gonna spend any of these until it attacks- 
Austin: Yeah, that’s fair. 
Sylvia: -is the thing, so-
Austin: You can do other stuff, I believe, but maybe-
Sylvia: Yeah, yeah. 
Austin: Can you? Can you? Can you do that without losing your-
Sylvia: I think as long as I’m still like, in the position-
Austin: Yeah. 
Sylvia: -or like, defending my stuff, it should be fine, like-
Austin: I think that that’s true. 
Sylvia: Um, but [inaudible] 
Austin: Um, I mean, I can add this complication to this which is, as Kodiak is trying really hard to get this razor, assassin vine, the vines is now moving back towards the the boar and therefore also back towards Benjamin. Um, and so in some ways, you have it even more boxed in than you did before. On the other hand, that vine is getting close to Benjamin. 
Sylvia: Alright. And I wouldn’t be able to use my hold to attack that- vi-
Austin: No. 
Sylvia: To do something to that vine, right?
Austin: No. 
Sylvia: Yeah, cause-
Austin: Only to- That vine would need to be attacking Throndir. 
Sylvia: Ok. Right. Um, can I just attack the vine with a Hack and Slash though?
Austin: Yeah, you’d have to- Yeah, you can- you can- based on the way this is lined up, yes. 
Sylvia: Ok. I’m thinking-
Austin: You can like, hop around basically. 
Sylvia: Alright. I’ll try- I’ll give that a shot. Um, I got a 7. 
Austin: Alright. That’s on your- to hit, right?
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: Uh, alright. It is going to- this means you both do damage to each other. 
Sylvia: Cool. 
Austin: Do your damage. 
Sylvia: Alright. Oh, yeah. I forgot I had to do mine first. Uh, and then this- I still have to add the plus 1 to my thing for this. Uh, so 5. 
Austin: So, 5. That’s not bad. Um, it does… 6. And that 6 is 1 piercing. It pierces 1 armor. 
Sylvia: Ok. So… I just take 6 damage. 
Austin: Um, you do, and then here’s the thing is uh, you’re also going to take um- as it hits you, you feel something enter your bloodstream. 
Sylvia: Hm. 
Austin: [thinking noises] Chu-chu-chu. Uh, you are going to take ‘sick’, the con- the constitution debility which lowers your constitution score by 1. [Sylvia sighs] So, you’d be like, ‘I’m-’
Keith: I feel like Ephrim’s been here recently. 
Austin: Uh huh. [Sylvia laughs softly] So, yeah. That is- that is- that has happened here. 
Sylvia: Alright. I think that’s all I have to do right now. 
Austin: Sure. 
Sylvia: Uh, is try and stop that, and then I’m in a cold position for now. 
Austin: Um-
Sylvia: But I mean, if I’m- if I’m able to speak, I will probably yell out to warn Benjamin. 
Austin: Oh yeah, totally. Benjamin sees it. Benjamin was facing that direction anyway-
Sylvia: Yeah. Ok. 
Austin: -and is like, trying to prep another magic attack here, but is also very clearly nervous and scared. What else is happenin’ down here between the boar, the- So, like, Throndir or Hadrian, which one of you is doing something here?
Art: I’m gonna- I’m gonna defend Benjamin. 
Austin: Ok. Give me your Defense roll. 
Art: Uh, great. Uh, I have like-
Austin: You- Do you get a bonus for this?
Art: I don’t have a bonus, but if I get a 6 or lower, I treat it as a 7 to 9. 
Austin: Ok, so even if you fail this roll, you’re going to succeed this roll. 
Art: Yeah, and I get 1- I get plus 1 armor when de- when defe- I take plus 1 armor forward when doing it. 
Austin: Ok. 
Art: And uh, one of the- what- how does defense-? Let’s just roll defense.
Austin: Roll defend, yeah. 2d6 plus uh- alright. So you got an 8. So yeah, you get 1 and you can spend it to half the attack’s effects, to open the attacker up to an ally, to deal damage to the attacker, or to redirect- It’s not in there for some reason, but to redirect that attack to you instead of them. 
Art: And I also- as part of my protection move, I get to add ‘give your ward an opportunity to escape  dangerous situation.’
Austin: Right, um-
Art: With the move ‘I’ll be there for you, when the rain starts to pour.’
Austin: Great. Thank you. [someone claps 4 times, like in ‘Friends’ and Austin laughs lightly] I used to love that song. Um, alright so you are now-
Art: It’s a good song. 
Austin: It’s a good song. Now you-
Art: It’s a shame that like, the- the version on the sh- the show uses isn’t- [inaudible] 
Austin: Isn’t- isn’t the good one? Yeah?
Art: Yeah.
Austin: Uh, what do you- Do you say something to Benjamin at this point?
Art: [sighs] I don’t know. I sort of want him to like, learn how to sorta do this. 
Austin: Ok. 
Art: But like, I also don’t want him to get killed by assassin vines. 
Austin: Yeah. Fair. 
Keith: Father’s dilemma. [Austin laughs] 
Art: What are you supposed to do?
Austin: Let’s- let’s do one more down here before we hop back up to Fero. Throndir, what are you doing?
Dre: Oh boy. Um-
Austin: I know. It’s not been going great, but Kodiak’s back in the mix at least. 
Dre: That’s true. Yeah, ok. Listen. My dog’s back. It’s time to- it’s time to be good at things again. 
Austin: Yep. 
Dre: So, I’m gonna Volley. 
Austin: Ok, you’re gonna shoot again at the boar or at the vines?
Dre: Oh, good question. Um, because one is attacking Benjamin, and the boar’s kind of on Ephrim right now?
Austin: Yeah, basically. 
Dre: Uh, I think at the vines. 
Austin: Ok. 
Dre: Uh, so that’s a 9. 
Austin: Alright, you don’t get a bonus to that from anything, right?
Dre: Uh, no. 
Austin: Ok. 
Dre: The only- the bonus I get from Kodiak comes in the damaging.
Austin: Ok, well, give me your damage. Or wait, actually, it’s Volley. So, what Volley says is, you either have to move to- move to get a better shot, you- in putting yourself in danger, you have to take what you can get minus 1d6 damage, or you have to take several shots, reducing your ammo. Pick one.
Dre: Uh, I’m gonna go ahead and reduce my ammo by 1. 
Austin: Where is your ammo? What do you- what’s your ammo right now?
Dre: It’s in my uh-
Austin: Oh, it’s over here. Dre: -gear. Austin: Yeah. 
Dre: Yeah. I’ve got 5 right now, so-
Austin: Alright, yeah. Go ahead and drop that to 4. No big deal. 
Dre: Or I’ve got 6 all- Now 5.
Austin: You’ll drop it to 5. Gotcha. Cool.
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin: Um, alright, do your damage. And make sure you add Kodiak’s bonus. It’s plus 2, I think for ferocity. Yeah. 
Dre: Ferocity, yeah. So, plus 2, yeah. 
Austin: So, 1d8 plus 4. Or plus 2. Alright! That’s 8. 
Dre: Alright. That’s 8. 
Austin: That’s 8. That ain’t bad. That ain’t- that ain’t bad. That got through. Um, and this is at the vine, right?
Dre: Uh hm. Yes. 
Austin: Alright. Alright, so most of that gets- Actually, yeah, almost all of that gets through. [thinking noise] Chu-chuuu. Cool. So yeah, you blast through, and it’s- it’s just weird cause like, you’re shooting a collection of vines. Do you know what I mean? And so like, some of it drops. Some of them- some of them drop away, but other parts, it’s like, ‘Oh, you hit the edge, and it didn’t kill it.’ You know? Like, you hit the bottom part of a hanging vine, there’s still way more vine to go, so it’s hard to tell how damaged this assassin vine is. Fero, this dryad is-
Keith: Hey. 
Austin: This dryad, at this point, is actually backing up and is like- I guess you- you got in on it, but is trying to like, whip the vines around in such a way to like, give it cover. Um, as it’s trying to back away and escape. 
Keith: Uh hm. 
Austin: What do you do?
Keith: Um, I’m going to Parley. 
Austin: Ok. What’s that look like?
Keith: Which is risky. 
Austin: Yeah, it is. 
Keith: I- So, I’m- I think that this- I think that- I think that they want- You- I mean, you said that they’re trying to escape. 
Austin: They’re trying to escape, yeah. 
Keith: What I want to do is get them to take the boars with them. 
Austin: Ok. 
Keith: Like, take your- take your crew and get out of here. 
Austin: Right. Uh, and the thing that you have that they want is their life, presumably. 
Keith: Yes. Yeah, like, either- either you take the boars or I’m not letting you run away. 
Austin: Right. Give me a Parley. It’s charisma. 
Keith: Charisma. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: Not my strong suit, if you can believe it. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Keith: 7. 
Austin: Still a 7. So, they need- they need some concrete assurance of your promise now. Um, so I think they’re like, um, 
Austin (as unnamed dryad): You’ll stab us all in the back. 
Keith (as Fero): Is- sorry- Is that a question or a statement or?
Austin (as unnamed dryad): Yes. 
Keith (as Fero): Uh… 
Austin: They’re looking for proof.
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, yeah. I’ll fo- I’ll for real stab. I will shoot you with this bow. 
Keith: I take out my bow. 
Art: You’re doing it wrong. 
Austin: You’re doing the opposite thing. 
Keith: Wait, wait, wait, wait. What is the- Sorry. I’m confused. What are-
Austin: They want- they want concrete assurance that you will not- that if they- if they retreat, you will not just kill them all. And shoot them in the back. 
Keith: Oh I thought- I thought they were saying like, ‘Oh, yeah, really? You’re gonna do it.’
Austin: [laughs] No, I mean there is a vagueness there. 
Keith: Ok. 
Austin: Like there is- they don’t know- they’re not speaking the language the way you’re speaking it, you know? That’s fair. But- but I think Fero gets what they’re saying, so I want to be clear. 
Keith: Yeah, yeah. Ok, ok. 
Austin: So, you need a concrete assurance that you will not stab them in the back and actually will let them go. 
[45:00]
Keith: Ok. Yeah, I- I drop um- I- Before I- Let’s pretend that I didn’t take out my bow. I probably had my- uh my knife out-
Austin: Yeah, you probably had your knife out. Yeah. 
Keith: And so I drop my knife and my- and my shield. 
Austin: Ok. Um, and then I think that they whip the- one of their vines through the air in such a way that it catches the uh, air and makes a- like a- almost like an alarm sound. 
Keith: Uh hm. 
Austin: And then you can hear the vines that are connecting to these other creatures go like- go [reverberating vine noise foley] ‘Bwaamg’ They go like, taut for a second, and then they slacken again, and then yes, everything starts to retreat. The boar does. The vine does. Everything else like, tries to get away. Kodiak is like, 
Austin (as Kodiak): [barking foley] Rar, rar, rar.
Austin: And like, snapping, but isn’t biting. Uh, Benjamin is ready to shoot one of these things in the back again. Uh, what do you do, Hadrian?
Art: Um, I like try to- I mean, I don’t- I don’t know how magic works really, but like, I try to like, get in the way. 
Austin: You like stand in the way?
Art: Like, 
Art (as Hadrian): Stop. Don’t-
Austin: Give me a- Yeah, what do you say?
Art (as Hadrian): You know, they’re- Don’t- don’t shoot someone who’s retreating. 
Austin: Give me a Defy Danger charisma. Um, you can stop this- you can stop them from getting hit by taking these hits. This magic missile hit. 
Art: Oh, that’s gonna fuckin’ trau- traumatizing. 
Austin: Uh hm. But he- it is too late for him to stop the spell. You can get out of the way, and like, it’s- it’s a success, so he wants to stop it. 
Keith: [overlapped] Can someone aid it? For a 10?
Austin: It’s clear that he wants to- Yeah, someone could aid it, totally. Uh, Ephrim or Throndir?
Dre: Oh boy. Um, I will aid. Yeah, sure. 
Austin: Go ahead and give me your aid. What, you have one bond with Hadrian, right? Go ahead and give me that roll. 
Dre: I know there’s a button for this, but I’m just gonna 2d6 +1. Oh boy.
Austin: Yo! [light laugh] 
Dre: Hey, all my- all the ones came back. [Keith laughs] 
Austin: They did. Um, you know, this is great cause we’re gonna get our like Gohan moment. Um- [light laugh] One second, I have to look up some shit about magic missile. Let’s see. Uh-
Art: Well, thanks for takin’ for me, I-
Dre: Damn. 
Keith: I think you both get hit. 
Austin: Yeah, you both are getting hit, for sure- for suresies. Uh, I just got to look through some shit that’s, ‘Woah, he can do that?’ Uh, here we go. Um-
Art: How does Bloody Aegis work? [light laugh]
Austin: [light laugh] I don’t know. You tell me. Uh, so what we’re getting is like- we’re getting Greater Empowered Magic. Which is on the 12 plus, you get to choose- uh,  you- sorry. Blah, blah, blah. Doesn’t really matter. I’m not gonna read the things. The point is the spell’s targets and effects are doubled, so that’s the two of you instead of just 1 target. And also, it’s doing double the damage, so get ready to get hit bad. 
Art: Is he- Is it one damage roll or are you gonna do one for each of us?
Austin: It’s- I’m gonna do one for each. Who wants it first? Who wants- who wants to get hit by this magic missile first?
Dre: [pause] Me. 
Austin: There we go. Alright. That’s 8. 
Art: [sound like gut-punch] Ooooh. 
Dre: Jesus. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Dre: Does armor do anything for this?
Austin: I think so. And that’s 12 to Hadrian. [Sylvia laughs lightly] 
Art: Alright, I want to Bloody Aegis this. 
Austin: What’s that mean? Why are you just saying words?
Art: Um, when you- [Keith laughs] ‘when you take damage you can grit your teeth and accept the blow.You take no damage, but instead suffer a debility of your choice.’
Austin: Ok. Which debility are you taking?
Art: Shaky. 
Austin: Yeah, f- you know what? Fair. [light laugh] Dropping you down to negative 1 DEX. Um, yeah, so I think between the 2 of you, you both like, get in the way. You’re like ‘Don’t do this.’, right? And there is something in being- there is something- when Benjamin gets, not reprimanded here, but like, you’re jumping in front- the intensity of trying to stop him, triggers something deep inside of him. And the spell, you know, basically quadruples in effect and hits both of you head on. Um, yeah. Hadrian, you grit your teeth and don’t feel it. You don’t feel the damage, but you certainly get- feel fuckin’ shaky. Throndir, yikes. 
Sylvia: Uh, I can’t spend my hold here to half this, can I?
Austin: Oh, you totally can. What’s that look like though?
Sylvia: Ok, Uh-
Austin: God. 
Sylvia: I think, man. Ok, so here’s my really like-
Austin: Yeah, do it. 
Sylvia: Back on my Echo shit a little bit-
Austin: Uh huh. 
Sylvia: -it- like, that sword. I gotta block it with that sword. 
Austin: You gotta block it with this magic sword, right?
Sylvia: And- [sighs] I think it does the thing where it- My really cool idea is-
Austin: Uh huh.
Sylvia: -that it splits in half and only half hits Throndir, and the other half just like, flies off into a tree somewhere. 
Austin: Oh, that’s good. So, you like, cut the magic missiles in half. [laughing] 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: Great. Love it. Good. Perfect. Alright. Uh, Benjamin like, drops his staff and is like, 
Austin (as Benjamin): Dad!
Austin: And like, runs over to see if you’re ok. 
Art (as Hadrian): It’s ok. It’s ok. We’re all fine. 
Austin (as Benjamin): I’m sorry. 
Art: He says without checking on Throndir at all. 
Austin (as Benjamin): Thro- Mr. Throndir. [light laugh] 
Dre (as Throndir): I’m fine. 
Austin (as Benjamin): Are you ok?
Dre (as Throndir): I’m good. I’m good. 
Austin: [laughing] Mr- Mr. Piccolo. [Sylvia and Dre laugh] 
Dre: No, that’s Fantasmo. Listen. 
Austin: Ok, right. Right, right, right. 
DRE; We’ve already laid this all out in the chat. 
Austin: [laughing throughout] I’m sorry I was not paying attention to chat. [Sylvia and Dre laugh] Uh, in chat Throndir says, ‘Ok, if Fantasmo is Mr. Piccolo and Hadrian is Goku… Wait, am I Krillin?’ Uh, adds uh, this is all- Wait, Keith, are you-? Keith says ‘Take [   ] you’re dad is re- He is really all grown up.’ True. Throndir says, ‘Yeah, if Ephrim is Trunks, then I’m definitely Krillin because Fero’s probably Vegeta.’ And Keith says, ‘I’m Goten or kid Trunks. Hella is Vegeta.’ Agreed. Agreed. 
Sylvia: Hella is Vegeta. 
Austin: Hella is Vegeta. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Austin; Wow, Hella’s Vegeta and Hadrian’s Goku. 
Dre: Yeah. 
Keith: Yeah, Hella is Vegeta down to being uh, like slightly less evil than people thought. 
Austin: Yes. [Dre laughs] God. Fuck. Uh, Benjamin is like-
Art: Hold on, I have to tweet that real quick. I’ll be right back. 
Austin: Uh huh. Go for it. [Dre laughs] Benjamin comes over to you, Throndir, also is like, 
Austin (as Benjamin): Are you ok? I’m so- Ahh. 
Dre (as Throndir): Uh, you’re- it’s- it’s- Listen. It’s good. 
Austin (as Benjamin): I just want- I thought they could- I thought- I was afraid that they would hurt us. 
Art (as Hadrian): I understand. Um, yeah. It happens sometimes. You’ll- you’ll learn to- to have a- to have a clearer head in these situations. It’s fine. You did great. I’m so proud of you. 
Austin: Uh, just as a note, Benjamin just did 20 damage with a single move. I don’t think-
Keith: That’s a lot. 
Dre: Yeah. That’s pretty fucked up. 
Austin: -that’s ever happened before. Yeah. 
Art: Well, he did zero to- to Hadrian. 
Austin: Yes. 
Art: So, it’s sort of like he did 8. 
Austin: [laughs] It’s- Right. Exactly. 
Dre: Jeez.
Sylvia: And technically, he did 4. 
Austin: He technically did 4. [Sylvia laughs] But I’m saying, he rolled 20. 
Sylvia: He rolled a 20. 
Keith: [imitating Benjamin] ‘Stop diminishing me, Dad!’ [Sylvia laughs hard]
Austin: [laughing] Yeah. 
Dre: Yeah, I’m just sayin’, out here diminishing your son’s accomplishments. Jesus. 
Sylvia: Really is Goku. [Dre laughs] 
Keith: [imitating Hadrian] ‘I’m so proud for the damage that you almost were able to do.’ 
Austin: Almost. Um, he’s like- he slowly picks the staff back up and like, sheathes it on a- on a, like a thing he has on his back. Like a strap he has on his back. Um, and he says, 
Austin (as Benjamin): That was… They were tryin’ to kill us. 
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah, they were. Um-
Dre (as Throndir): Yeah. 
Art (as Hadrian): Uh huh. 
Austin (as Benjamin): Can we go back?
Keith (as Fero): Hey guys, good fight!
Austin (as Benjamin): Hi, Fero. 
Art (as Hadrian): Where were you?
Keith (as Fero): I was up there. I was- the- the drya- 
Keith: -the dry- dry- Do I know this was a dryad? You said dryad earlier. 
Austin: Probably have heard the word dryad in your life. 
Keith (as Fero): This dryad, I mean, dryad, druid, same sort of thing. That dryad was- I was fightin’ the dryad that was controlling all the warthogs. 
Dre (as Throndir): Oh. 
Keith (as Fero): Ho- boars. Boarthogs. 
Austin (as Benjamin): I think we just call- Yeah. I don’t know. 
Keith (as Fero): Not a warthog. They were boars. 
Austin (as Benjamin): They were- What’s the difference?
Keith: Warthogs are from Africa. 
Austin: [still in Benjamin’s voice] That’s a specific place that doesn’t exist in our world. So, probably not those. But I guess boars are also exist from places that aren’t Africa, so I don’t know. 
Austin (as Benjamin): I don’t know which it was. Let’s go home. 
Keith (as Fero): A boar is a- a boar is like, a feral pig. And a warthog is like a type of wild hog. 
Austin): Gotcha.
Keith: That’s the difference. 
Austin: That’s a good difference. You all make it back to camp. Benjamin is like, being- is not sure about what just happened and isn’t sure how to like, work through it and is not talking about it. Um, or is not- is not initiating conversation about it, I should be clear. It’s not that he’s like, refusing to talk about it, you know?
Art: Yeah, we should probably talk about it. 
Austin: So like, over dinner?
Art: Yeah. I mean, it’s-
Austin: Like after dinner? What’s the- what’s the play?
Art: It’s tricky, right? Because this is what Hadrian does.
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: And it’s- and so like, Hadrian can’t be like, ‘You can’t do this.’ 
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: It’s about like, ‘do you want to do it?’
Austin: Is that what you say to him?
Art: Yeah, except with the right-
Austin: No, we can jump in it. You’re-
Art: -with the right nouns. 
Austin: Yeah. He’s like, 
Austin (as Benjamin): I mean- [exhales] If I hadn’t- If I hadn’t made- [exhales] I was tryin’ to help. If I-
Art (as Hadrian): You did help. 
Austin (as Benjamin): If I can do this, and I choose not to help, doesn’t that make me a bad guy?
Austin: He wouldn’t say bad guy. He’s 18. 
Austin (as Benjamin): Doesn’t that make me an asshole?
Keith (as Fero): No. 
Austin (as Benjamin): But you know what I mean. 
Art (as Hadrian): No. The world needs scholars and academics and fathers and sons and citizens. You don’t need to do anything. 
Austin: Rosana is like, 
Austin (as Rosana): There are so many ways for you to help people. Don’t let anyone ever tell you the only way you can help someone is through violence. 
Austin: And Benjamin is like, 
Austin (as Benjamin): Yeah, but what about Ordenna and Arrell and-? [exhales] There are so many things in the world right now. So many people who hurt other people. I’m just supposed to-
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah. 
Austin (as Benjamin): Like, I’m scared. I’m not saying I’m not scared. But I will feel really bad if, if things- if I ever feel like I could have helped save someone or protect someone. If I don’t have the ability to do that- or what if this happens again and I still don’t know how to control this? And next time it goes worse and people do get hurt because I didn’t-
Art (as Hadrian): You will get better every time. And eventually, it won’t happen. You’ll do it again and again, and eventually, you’ll be great at it like you’re great at the things you already know how to do. What was it like the first time you tried to cast a spell?
Austin (as Benjamin): I don’t know. It wasn’t- I was tryin’ to make a light. Like a little light. But instead I- Blue J- Blue J couldn’t see anything for the next day. I was way too bright. 
Art (as Hadrian): Ok. And you- and you tried it again, and it went better?
Austin (as Benjamin): No, the second time, Sunder couldn’t see anything for a day. But the third time, it got a little bit better. It was like, a little, little ball that I could move around. And then, yeah. It got better. 
Art (as Hadrian): Then Sunder could only not see for 6 hours. [Austin and Art laugh lightly] Um- yeah, and that’s what- that’s what- that’s what we- that’s what- That’s what- what we do- [Austin laughs]
Keith: That’s in character.
Austin: Uh huh. Yep. 
Art (as Hadrian): That’s what it’s like to be us. 
Austin (as Benjamin): Alright. 
Art (as Hadrian): When we get back- Hm, no, nevermind. I was gonna tell you to ask Hella about the first time she fought someone, but what a terr- Don’t do that. [Austin laughs hard] Don’t talk to Hella about this. 
Sylvia: Man, imagine if someone was in the party who had magic from a young age. 
Austin: Yeah. Uh huh. 
Sylvia: Weird. 
[crosstalking]
Art: You can jump in at any time. 
Austin: I mean, y’all can be at this conversation. This seems like a public-y space.
Sylvia: True. True Ok. I wasn’t sure if this was a one on one. 
Austin: No, no, no, no. Please. 
Sylvia: Because like, I think like, Ephrim’s just like, 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): You just need to practice more. We can set up spots on the- We have that target range. We can, when we’re back, you can practice more, but if you need- [exhales] Obviously our magics are a little different, but I know how to work with destructive forces in a safer way. So, if you ever want to try those spells out, let me know. And I’ll be there. Ok?
Austin (as Benjamin): I- I don’t mean to… You don’t have to tell me, but why didn’t you use magic in the fight against the boars?
Sylvia (as Ephrim): [exhales] 
Austin: Fero knows this was a fight against a dryad, but no one else saw the dryad. [laughs]
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin: And so-
Keith: I explained it. I explained it. 
Austin: I know. I know. I just think it’s funny that in his mind, he’s like, we fought some boars. 
Keith: Yeah, yeah. We fought some boars, and Fero was away from us doing nothing.
Austin: [laughs] I think he knows that you’re not- You weren’t fuckin’ off, but it is just like, in his memory about the time some of you fought boars- [light laugh] 
Sylvia: I think Ephrim’s gonna lie and be like-
Austin: Hmm. 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): I underestimated them. But thankfully, we had another powerful magic user there to help, right?
Sylvia: He’s totally just trying to misdirect this so people don’t know that he can’t do his fire anymore. 
Austin: Right. 
Sylvia: But it sounds very sweet. 
Austin: He’s like, 
Austin (as Benjamin): Yeah. Yeah, Fero-
Art: Studio Audience, ‘Aww’. [Austin laughs] 
Austin (as Benjamin): Yeah, Fero was there. Powerful magic user. 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Be- Benjamin. You’re pretty good at this. It’s just refining it. 
Keith: One and a half powerful magic users. 
Austin: Aww. Yeah- [light laugh]
Sylvia: Fero, you don’t need to make any jokes about your height, dude. Like, come on. [Austin laughs] 
Art: Oooohhhhh. [Austin laughs] 
Sylvia: That was out of character. [laughing] 
Austin: Oh boy. 
Keith: Wait, are- Is that Ephrim saying, ‘Sorry for saying that. That was out of character for me?’ [Austin and Sylvia laugh] Or was that you, Sylvia, saying-?
Sylvia: No, that is Sylvia saying ‘that’s not canonical. Ephrim just thought that’.
Austin: Ok, yeah. Um, alright. I think, at this point, you finish that- this- this uh, evening meal, and the day breaks, and you’re able to follow the rest of the path toward the north- northeast where finally the- You know, it kind of like- it goes from forest to jungle to kind of tropical beach. You can see- as you kind of get closer and closer to the final treelines, you start to see smaller towns and villages on the- on the kind of southeast coast here, as you kind of near the most northeastern part of Hieron. 
[1:00:00]
Austin (continued): And I think, somewhere along the way, you- you pass through past like a- another traveler. You learn what was happening with the Grand Tour, which is that the Grand Tour, as it once was, has been dissolved. Um, and the people- the people breaking away were people going back to their homes. Some of which were their ancestral homes. Their homes from hundreds of years ago. Um, you don’t really get all the details. Like, people pass by don’t necessarily know how that works, but that is what you gather from- from some conversations. 
And finally you make it to the- you make it out of the trees and to a beach that then turns into just kind of like a long, rocky, sandbar that connects to the islands of Alcyon. There is- there is like, a land bridge here. It is not on the map, as it’s drawn currently, that con- the connects. It’s as if the water here is lower than it is on this- this map. And you don't know why that is. You don’t know if that’s because the map was always inaccurate or if the Heat and the Dark has literally swallowed away so much water that the- that it’s changed. Or if it’s always been like that. Like, you don’t- you don’t know, but there is a land bridge that connects the northeast to these islands. Um, that is like, you know, high tide will make parts of the land bridges go under, but when tide is low, you can travel by- you know, from one of these islands to the next just by walking. 
And as you get closer, you spot- [exhales] God, alright. So, the first thing you do is you start spotting people who are in tents who are former members of the Grand Tour who are still on the mainland and have not crossed into this first island yet. Um, so they’re like, here where I just pinged. Did I move you to the right map yet? Yes, I did. So, like here. And I think one of them calls out to you as you kind of travel with your horses. Um, let me see. What is his name? One second here. Here we go. He is like a- uh, kind of a burly dude. It’s actually two people here. So, there’s like a burly dude um, who is a… clearly a um… a former soldier who is kind of burly and young. And uh, big shoulders. Wearing black and blue colors. Is like, fanning himself on a- on a seat. And then with him is someone. They are also kind of big, but like, heavier. They’re like, chunky. They’re big and chunky. They have a big- they have a big mustache. They have a big barrel body. This is Berk and Vilda. Vilda is the one who is- who is like, fanning himself. Uh, and Berk is the one who is- I think probably like, working on some sort of cold stew. Or maybe not- not a cold stew cause it’s- they don’t- they don’t know how to make things cold. Workin’ on a stew out here. And **Berk who is fanning himself is like, 
[**Austin says Berk, but means Vilda]
Austin (as Vilda): Flesh folks like you and us. We don’t belong here anymore. You should just turn the other way. 
Keith (as Fero): What? Excuse me?
Austin (as Vilda): It’s a waste of your time comin’ to Alcyon. Apparently we’re not allowed here anymore. 
Keith (as Fero): Oh. That’s so-
Art (as Hadrian): Who told you that? Oh.
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Vilda): Well, you know, you know step another- you know, go across that land bridge, you know you’re gonna find? A bunch of metal people, and they’re not even allowed in. Only the stone people. 
Austin: And Berk is like- 
Keith (as Fero): Damn.
Austin: Berk says like, 
Austin (as Berk): Vilda, please, can you not yell at people in the middle of the day? Does anyone want any stew? I’m making stew. 
Keith (as Fero): What’s the temperature of it?
Austin (as Berk): I would say room temperature, but we’re outside. So, it’s like a big room. 
Keith (as Fero): Ok. 
Art (as Hadrian): Ah, big room temperature. 
Keith (as Fero): Air temperature. 
Austin (as Berk): Air temperature. I like big room temperature more though.
Austin: Do you-
Keith (as Fero): We could cook it. Ephrim could probably cook it. 
Austin (as Berk): I mean, I could cook it, but it’s hot. 
Keith (as Fero): Oh, you don’t want hot. 
Austin (as Berk): I don’t want hot. 
Keith (as Fero): You want some-
Austin (as Berk): I had enough hot stew in my own life for at least 3 lifetimes. 
Keith (as Fero): Do any of us do ice powers?
Austin (as Vilda): Oh, these guys have powers.
Austin: Says Ber- er says Vilda. Berk is like, 
Austin (as Berk): Please calm down. 
Keith (as Fero): Do any- but for real though, do any of us have ice powers?
Austin (as Benjamin): I don’t think so. 
Austin: Says Benjamin. [light laugh] 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): I just do the opposite.
Art (as Hadrian): I don’t really have powers anymore. 
Austin: Uh, Marigold says, um, 
Austin (as Marigold): I could climb the mountains nearby and come back with some ice.
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, anybo- Any of us could do that. 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Hey!
Keith (as Fero): I mean-
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Don’t be rude to Marigold. 
Keith (as Fero): Sorry, no. You’re right. 
Austin (as Marigold): I was just trying to help. I was just-
Keith (as Fero): That’s fine. No. 
Austin (as Marigold): -thinking of solutions. 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Thank you, Marigold. 
Austin (as Marigold): I’m very solution-oriented.
Sylvia (as Ephrim): And that’s why I brought you. Thank you. I think we’re good- I don’t think we’re gonna be going into the mountains though. It’s a bit off course. I appreciate the suggestion. 
Austin (as Marigold): Ok. Well, next time. 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Next time. 
Austin: Um, you can see the southeast from here. Like, there are some walls. There are- The actual islands are kind of tiered. Like, not- not one after the other, but like, they each have a sort of tiered, almost Greek, sty- Greek or Italian, southern Europe style raised hills. There are some vineyards that you can see from here off in the distance. And the two people talking here aren’t wrong. You can see that there is like a big wall across the first land bridge. And outside of that wall are a bunch of figures. And you can’t see what’s beyond that, but- And way off in the distance, you can, of course, see the huge, colossus-like statue of Galenica out on the furthest island where there is this red mark on our map. And you know, in your heart of hearts, this is the final tower that we have not seen- [light laugh] on this- in this game yet. 
Keith: [jokingly as Fero] I know in my heart of hearts, that’s the final tower. 
Austin: Yeah, that’s it. The final one. 
Austin (as Berk): So, what are you here for? Do you- I- You could come over here, and we could stop shouting or you go about your day! Either-
Keith: Yeah, I walk over. 
Sylvia: Yeah. 
Austin (as Berk): Hi. Hey, I’m-
Keith (as Fero): Hey.
Austin (as Berk): I’m Berk. This is- this is Vilda. 
Keith (as Fero): I’m Fero. 
Austin (as Berk): Hi, Fero. You have a lot of people, huh?
Keith (as Fero): Yeah, we do have a lot of people. 
Art (as Hadrian): We almost brought an oni.
Keith (as Fero): We usually don’t have so many.
Austin (as Berk): So, you uh, tour?
Sylvia (as Ephrim): No. 
Keith (as Fero): Sorry, what? No, we’re on business. 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Absolutely not. [light laugh] 
Austin (as Berk): No, the Grand- the Grand Tour. Were you part of the-
Keith (as Fero): Oh, ok. No, all still no.
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Again, absolutely not. 
Keith (as Fero): I met them once, and it was… 
Austin: Uh, Vilda is like, 
Austin (as Vilda): I served my duty. And I saw the world. And now I’m trying to go back to where my family is from, but um, apparently not allowed. 
Austin: **Vilda says like,                       [**Austin means Berk]
Austin (as Berk): You don’t even know that. We just didn’t want to- There were people there that are made of metal. And they seemed very adamant about getting in and I didn’t want to be seen as part of any troublemakers, so we’re just gonna let that play out. And then we’re gonna try to go in. 
Art (as Hadrian): Sure. Um-
Keith (as Fero): What do you have against troublemakers?
Austin (as Berk): I just- I’ve seen a lot of trouble, and I want to retire from it for a little while. 
Keith (as Fero): Ok. 
Art (as Hadrian): Um, the- the metal men, did they-? You talk to any of them? You hear any words?
Austin (as Berk): Absolutely not. 
Keith (as Fero): Why not? What do you have against metal men?
Austin (as Berk): I fought a few over the years. Um, and mostly they try to kill me. 
Keith (as Fero): Damn, ok. Yeah, that’s fair. 
Austin (as Berk): They-
Art (as Hadrian): You reckon- hm.
Austin: What’s up?
Art (as Hadrian): You reckon they were uh, Ordennan? 
Austin: Vilda nods, 
Austin (as Vilda): Yeah, definitely Ordennan. The black and the gold and all that? Definitely Ordennan.
Art (as Hadrian): Cool.
Keith (as Fero): Oh wait, is there another metal man that I didn’t know about?
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah, the Ordennans have an army of metal Ordenna steel pala-din. 
Keith (as Fero): No, no. Those ones I do know about. Is there another metal man?
Austin: No. 
Keith: No? Ok. 
Art: I mean, but this- this person’s asserting that there’s other metal men. 
Keith (as Fero): How many different kinds of metal men do you know about?
Austin (as Vilda): Seven.
Keith (as Fero): Wow. 
Art (as Hadrian): Woah.
Keith (as Fero): Can you name them?
Dre (as Throndir): Holy shit. 
Austin (as Vilda): I- Most of them tried to kill me. 
Keith (as Fero): Alright, let’s hear ‘em. We got- well let’s start with the one that we know. 
Austin (as Vilda): The Ordennans? Those are the ones that you know. 
Art: This is the Lazer Ted of golems. 
Keith (as Fero): Ok, one.
Austin (as Vilda): Yeah. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Vilda): Two, the- the um, the animated metal corpses of the- the great tombs of Bakkah. 
Keith (as Fero): Ok. Got two. Got it. 
Austin (as Vilda): And the- the evil- the evil, dark mage, of course, animated those. Uh, three, the enchanted suits of armor at Baron’s Gate. Those are metal men. Uh, that’s three. Four, the uh, the magma wharvers of- of the deep under- under-Buoy, where the magma settles and it’s like, they’re like, half- half-wharver, half-metallic metal liquid-metal men. That’s four. Um, you have, of course, the- the sea witches in uh, trident. Living trident men. I know what you’re thinking. [light laugh] A trident. That’s like a pitch fork, but these were man-shaped. They were- they had metal parts. 
Keith (as Fero): Pitchfolk. [Sylvia laughs] 
Austin (as Vilda): Right, the pitchfolk. Thank you for reminding me of their real, definite canon name. 
Sylvia: Ephrim- Ephrim’s just been like, nodding to each of these, and then when they get to the trident people, they’re just like, ‘uh, mmm, I haven’t heard of that one’. 
Austin: ‘Un, that one not- Hm, no. That one’s not true. That one’s not- Hm, ok.’ Uh, 
Austin (as Vilda): And of course, the elusive foil being. [Sylvia laughs] 
Keith (as Fero): There’s one- That was six. You got one more. 
Austin (as Vilda): He’s very elusive. 
Keith (as Fero): Oh, it counts for two?
Austin (as Vilda): It counts for two. He counts twice. 
Keith (as Fero): Damn, there’s a lot of- there’s a lot of metal people out there. 
Austin (as Vilda): But these are the Ordennan ones, for sure. 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. Are you sure there’s not some pitchfolk in there?
Austin: Berk is like, 
Austin (as Berk): There might be some pitchfolk in there. 
Dre: Oh. 
Keith (as Fero): Well, we’re- we have to go. 
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Yeah, we- we have- We definitely have to go now that we know the Ordennans are there. Like, even more so. 
Austin (as Berk): So, you from here or what’s the-?
Keith (as Fero): Um, no. We’re on bu- on business.
Austin: Really thought you were gonna say bitcoin. Really thought- you were like, ‘No, we’re on bitcoin now.’
Keith: ‘We’re on bitcoin. We’re on bitcoin. You hear about that?’ [Austin and Sylvia laugh softly.]
Austin: ‘Absolutely not’. Um-
Sylvia: That’s what’s powering the Heat and the Dark.
Austin (as Berk): Business? 
Keith (as Fero): Yeah. 
Austin (as Berk): Well, good luck. 
Keith (as Fero): Thank you. 
Austin (as Berk): That was like a, not a sarcastic- I do hope you have good luck. I’m just saying it seems like-
Keith (as Fero): Thank you. 
Austin (as Berk): Ok. 
Austin: Do y’all head down that way? What’s the play?
Dre: Uh-
Art: Yeah, I don’t have any- I don’t have-
Keith (as Fero): I mean, we’re gonna try really hard to get in. If- if you guys wanna like, come try to get in. 
Austin (as Berk): No, I’m gonna finish this stew, and then if you get in-
Keith (as Fero): Right. 
Austin (as Berk): -you send the word back maybe, and we’ll try to get in. 
Keith (as Fero): Alright. We’ll get- We will get in. 
Austin: Jump-cut. [light laugh] Smash cut. You’ve come across the other side of the bridge. The land bridge. And the tide is actually getting higher, so you’re gonna be on the edge of this first island, at least, for now. There is a big stone wall with like, a big gate, and there are guards on the towers who are silhouetted against the- the setting sun in the sky. And there are a bunch of Ordennan anchor facing the wall, and some of them are sitting. Some of them are standing. Some of them seem to be talking to each other. And at the door, talking to a figure cut in stone is another figure cut in metal. Um, who here? Uh, Hadrian, you recognize the cut of this- of the metal one. It is a Fel anchor. They are the ones who are red and were modeled after Iduna Fel, traitor to the Ordennans. Or at least, presumed traitor to the Ordennans. These are like, the special ones that can do like, spider-walking and have flamethrowers and shit that you fought at the very end of Winter. 
Art: Yeah. 
Austin: And this one seems to be talking to a person made of stone. 
Art: What like a- like a- like a pala- 
Austin: Like a pala-din. 
Art: Like a regular pala-din?
Austin: Like a regular pala-din. 
Art: I wonder if- Hmm. Um, alright. Hadrian takes out his- his star sword. 
Austin: Oh boy. 
Dre: Oh jeez.
Art: Not-
Austin: Uh, I think like, at doing that, Rosana is like, 
Austin (as Rosana): Hadrian. 
Art (as Hadrian): No, don’t worry. I think- I think I can do this. 
Art: Ron Howard voice. ‘He couldn’t.’ [Austin laughs] 
Art (as Hadrian): I have- I have divine authority. They should respect that. 
Austin: Rosana says, 
Austin (as Rosana): We know the anchor won’t. 
Art (as Hadrian): They did once though. 
Austin (as Rosana): Oh. 
Art (as Hadrian): I was able to- I was able to control one of them. 
Austin: I think Benjamin is like, 
Austin (as Benjamin): But [sighs] isn’t your connection to Samothes… gone?
Art (as Hadrian): Yes. But- [Austin and Art laugh lightly] 
Austin: Ooookay. 
Art: And I think like, Ha- like Hadrian just sort of like, tried to like, brush people aside, like-
Austin: Ok. 
Art (as Hadrian): Excuse me. Stand aside. Coming through. 
Austin: And they do. 
Art (as Hadrian): Representative of Samothes coming through. 
Austin: [light laugh] Yeah, there are some- they don’t have eyebrow- Most of them don’t have eyebrows. As a reminder, the anchor are- they all come in like, different- There’s like different brands of anchor because there were competing Ordennan anchor smiths. And so you know, there’s some of them that are like, round and cylindrical. And other ones are kind of sharp and angular, but they all still basically come in different sets like that. What is different as you move through them and you notice is they all have like, different additional markings that have been added. Some people have marked their faces with like, different like, uh kind of geometric shapes and lines. Others have broken off parts of their own bodies, removing a pauldron to reveal the working- the working of the gears underneath or adding a second or third pauldron in some places. You know, they kind of stack up. There’s lot of like, gear customization. There’s lots of like, Gunpla-style kitbashing going on that you, the listener, can know is about these people kind of identifying themselves and building bodies that they- that they like. 
[1:15:00]
Austin (continued): The players don’t know- the characters don’t necessarily know that yet. Um, they all move out of your way. Where are you going?
Art: Up to the front. To the door. 
Austin: Ok, so you-
Art: I want to hear this conversation. 
Austin: Alright, so you go to the door, and what you hear is like- The Fel anchor is like, 
Austin (as unnamed Fel anchor): We’ve been out here a month. You know our supplies are running low. How much longer?
Austin: And the pala-din says, 
Austin (as unnamed pala-din): Another few days. Tabard is working as quickly as he can. 
Art: Tabard?
Austin: Is that what you say? [Keith laughs throughout] Hadrian, ‘I’m gonna go up there. I’m gonna fuckin’- They’re gonna listen to me….. Tabard?’
Art: I saw that guy die. [laughs] 
Austin: You saw that guy get stabbed. 
Art: Didn’t you-
Austin: You saw that guy get the damage that you took. You saw that pala-
Art: He took all of my damage. 
Austin: He did take all of your damage. You saw that-
Art: I was gonna be dead. 
Austin: You were gonna be dead. He is a pala-din.
Art: I was a paladin.
Austin: You were. 
Keith: Very close, phonetically. 
Austin: [light laugh] Very. This- this pala-din turns and looks at you and says, 
Austin (as unnamed pala-din): Excuse. I’m in the middle of something here. 
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah. Um, can you tell- can you tell Tabard that Hadrian’s here?
Austin (as unnamed pala-din): Sir, I’m gonna need you to take a step back. I’m in the in the middle of something here. Can you please- There is a- a system to this. Please let your nearest representative know that you need to- to pass word along. 
Art (as Hadrian): I’m- The- No one- I don’t have a- I am my rep- I am my representative. 
Austin (as unnamed pala-din): No, I- I mean whoever uh, is associated with your block of people waiting to enter Alcyon. 
Art (as Hadrian): No, I- I still think you don’t understand. I am the representative for my block. 
Austin (as unnamed pala-din): You want-
Art (as Hadrian): Hadrian, Sword of Samothes, Defender of the Undying Fire, Order-
Austin (as unnamed pala-din): Ok. 
Art (as Hadrian): Officer of the Order of Eternal Princes. 
Austin (as unnamed pala-din): Samothes, ok. 
Austin: Do you have a roll here? Is there a roll for- for this thing you’re trying to do? Or are you just tryin’ to do it?
Art: I’m just tryin’ to- I’m just tryin’ to talk to this person. 
Austin: He’s like-
Art: I’ll roll whatever you want me to do. 
Austin: They say, 
Austin (as unnamed pala-din): A representative would be assigned to your group based on when you arrived. And your needs will a- evaluated and met with the appropriate degr- I’m- Apologies to Miss Fel here, uh, I will… Miss Fel, I will handle you uh, your complaint as quickly as I can. Hadrian, Sword of Samothes, Defender of the Undying Fire, please uh, return to your representative. The representative has not been ap- appointed to you, please give us a moment, and we will make sure that one is- is given to you as quickly as possible. You, of course, deserve an advocate, and as soon as you have one assigned, we can begin the proceedings. 
Art (as Hadrian): This is literally the sword of Samothes. I just want to- just get that clear here and now. 
Austin (as unnamed pala-din): Ok. [sighs]
Austin: Give me a pa- You- Give me a Parley. [light laugh] 
Art: I just can’t believe we go all over the world, and everyone’s just rude as shit. [Austin laughs] 
Austin: So he’s like, 
Austin (as unnamed pala-din): That’s the sword of Samothes. 
Austin: Alright. Um, so you rolled an 8 on your Parley which means that you need to- you need to uh, do something to show concrete evidence. I think in this case, this guard is like, 
Austin (as unnamed pala-din): Can I see the sword? Let me hold it.
Art: Hey, um, I’m gonna spend a moment. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: And ask ‘What here is here is evil?’
Austin: Good call. Um, as far as Samot can tell, nothing. 
Art: He’s a sharp guy. 
Austin: Yeah. [Keith laughs] 
Art: A good judge of character, at least. 
Austin: Yeah. 
Art: Smarter than me. 
Austin: Yeah. [light laugh] [Keith laughs again] 
Art (as Hadrian): You’re gonna- you’re gonna return it, right?
Austin: They nod. They’re just like, 
Austin (as unnamed pala-din): It gleams. 
Art (as Hadrian): Yeah, it’s awesome. Here. [Keith laughs] 
Austin: And they take it slowly and hold it. And they say, 
Austin (as unnamed pala-din): Samothes made this.
Art (as Hadrian): Uh hm. The original Samothes. [Keith laughs again] 
Austin: And at that they squint. Pala-din squinting is a weird thing for- Like, these pala-din have animated faces. They still have stone faces. They do not have eyeballs. They don’t have- They’re like- they have eyes carved into their faces. Do you know what I mean? But like, it is like, just moving stone, ya know? And it’s not slow or- it’s like 60 frames a second, ya know? [laughs] It’s like clean faces. 
Keith: Wow. Full 60?
Austin: Full 60. We got that full 60.
Keith: What kind of hardware they got in there?
Austin: The got- They are- they’re doin’ the thing where you get two- you get SLI. You know, the double thing, and it’s like two GTXs. GTX-
Keith: I didn’t know that they did that anymore. I thought they discontinued that. 
Austin: No, they still- It’s custom, ya know? It’s custom. 
Keith: Oh ok. 
Austin: Liquid cooling. Um, so-
Keith: Nice. 
Austin: Yeah, 1440 resolution, so-
Keith: Look at those LEDs.
Austin: I know. 
Keith: You can really look in- inside of there-
Austin: You can- It’s all glowing. 
Keith: -and see how bright it is. 
Austin: It’s really bright. It has the- one of those glass sides. You just pop that open. You don’t have to like, get a screwdriver out- 
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: -if you want to add more RAM or whatever. Um-
Keith: And I do. 
Austin: The guard hands it back to you, and they say like, 
Austin (as unnamed pala-din): Let me finish with Miss Fel. I will attend to your group momentarily. 
Art (as Hadrian): Sure. Great. 
Austin (as unnamed pala-din): You’re back-
Art (as Hadrian): Thanks. 
Austin (as unnamed pala-din): Ok. 
Austin: Um, and-
Art: Hadrian like, turns around and gives a thumbs up. [Austin laughs softly] Cause this is the first time that like, [laughing] talking to people has ever worked for him. 
Austin: Yeah. Yeah. Um, all through this, I- I need to just double check some old shit. This- this uh, Fel anchor who is being called Miss Fel, is like giving you a side- sidelong glance. Not evil, but… 
Keith: But sidelong at least. 
Austin: You- Do you remember what you did? Hadrian, do you remember what you did? [laughs] 
Art: It was a long time ago. 
Austin: It was. 
Art: It was 10 years ago. I- We won. 
Austin: You- [laughs] You did win. Uh, let’s see. So, just as a reminder. Iduna Fel was one of the potential uh- was one of the suspects. She was a-
Art: Oh. 
Austin: Uh huh. 
Art: Hmm. 
Austin: Uh huh. Um, there wa- She was one of the suspects for killing Chair- Chairman Lutz, or uh, not Chairman Lutz… Was it Chairman?
Keith: Mayor?
Austin: Maybe it was- No, it was-
Sylvia: I think it was Chairman. Wasn’t it?
Austin: No, it wasn’t chairman. It was Chancellor. 
Keith: I thought it was mayor. 
Sylvia: Counselor?
Austin: Chancellor. 
Sylvia: Chancellor. 
Austin: Chancellor. No, there are mayors throughout Rosemerrow. One chancellor. 
Sylvia: Right. 
Austin: Uh, Iduna Fel was one of- was a- was a Justiciar who was evil at the time. Is not evil- this- this version of her is not evil anyway. Um, and was also someone who the Ordennans also didn’t like. And in the end you sold her out to the Ordennans in exchange for… I don’t think really anything. 
Keith: Yikes. 
Austin: Um, and she had been investigating the stars. And you know. 
Keith: But you said that at that point, was evil. 
Austin: Yeah, and then at some- and then Hadrian narced her out. They found her and seem to have turned her into an entire model of new Fel anchor. Fel from her name. F-E-L.
Keith: Yeah. 
Austin: Um, so yeah. This one is giving you uh, some looks. But you’re able to go back to your-
Art: I shouldn’t have used my name. 
Austin: You shouldn’t- No, uh un. 
Art: I’d be so much older.
Keith: I feel like narcing always comes around to bite us in the ass. 
Austin: Almost always. Weird.
Art: Weird. 
Austin: It’s like there’s an ethos to this show. Um, yeah. And so, this- this pala-din finishes speaking with- with Fel and then after about 20 minutes comes over to you and introduces themselves to you. Um, they are Hisam. H-I-S-A-M. [thinking sounds] chu-chu-chu [typing] And they say, 
Austin (as Hisam): Welcome to Alcyon. I will be your representative and advocate. My name is Hisam. You carry a very powerful thing, Hadrian. 
Art (as Hadrian): Hmm. 
Austin (as Hisam): And you carry his blessing. 
Art (as Hadrian): Yes. 
Austin (as Hisam): Well, what is your business here? 
Art (as Hadrian): Um, we were sent here…
Austin: Rosana like, puts a hand on the- the small of your back as if to say, ‘Very careful now.’ [light laugh] 
Art (as Hadrian): We were sent here on the authority of Samot. 
Art: Technically true.
Sylvia: And- and the authority of Lord Ephrim who runs the Last University. 
Austin: Do you say that, Ephrim?
Sylvia: No, but li-  but- I think Ephrim coughs and just like, [Austin laughs lightly]
Sylvia (as Ephrim): [clears throat with cough] We’re also here on Last University business. I’m Lord Ephrim. Pleasure to meet you. 
Keith: Fero rolls his eyes. 
Austin (as Hisam): You’ve brought a large delegation and a number of weapons. What do you-
Sylvia (as Ephrim): The trip here was dangerous. 
Austin (as Hisam): Of course. What do you seek from Alcyon?
Keith: I mean, I have- I think that there’s a way to answer this that isn’t- that isn’t damning because there’s a lot of things we seek here. 
Austin: Do you say something, Fero?
Keith: Yeah. 
Keith (as Fero): It’s ma- mag- Magic is disappearing on the borders of the continent, but not from here. 
Austin: I think they-
Keith (as Fero): And we’ve come to find out why. 
Austin: They squint at you, and they say, 
Austin (as Hisam): I see. We have not- I mean, it is as you say, there is no- If magic was leaving the world, I promise we would- our corner of the world, we would feel it, so I suppose it is right to say it hasn’t left us. 
Keith (as Fero): Uh hm. 
Austin (as Hisam): And you wish to study this question? All nine of you? 
Keith (as Fero): Yes. 
Austin (as Hisam): Are you-
Sylvia (as Ephrim): Well… I- Part of our delegation is also here to, as a them- a diplomatic envoy from the Last University trying to make contact with Alcyon. 
Austin (as Hisam): I see. The Last University. We’ve heard a rumor here or there that classes are being taught there again. We… Um, of course. Of course. I will also- diplomatic mission and an academic one. I will do everything in my power to get you sorted as soon as I can. Please understand that- please understand Alcyon’s ways. We must take care in all actions. There are not that many of us, and there are… limits to the ways- There are ways in which we are more vulnerable than many on this world. And there are things that we can do that others cannot. And so, we must take care to ensure that those who come to visit or stay are not put in harm’s way nor do they risk any of us. But of course, a delegation like yours should be- should be heard and welcomed. So, please give me a day to sort paperwork. There will be food provided. I suspect, unlike many of our other guests, you are all hungry. Um, do you have any dietary concerns?
Art (as Hadrian): I don’t think so. Does anyone?
Sylvia: Uh, [light laugh] Throndir, maybe? [Austin and Dre laugh] That’s not an in-character joke. I can’t- I don’t- I don’t- I think Ephrim would know that. Maybe Ephrim just kind of looks at Throndir. [laughs] 
Austin: Good. Great. 
Dre (as Throndir): Nah, I’m good. 
Austin (as Hisam): Very well. And Hadrian, you said your name was. 
Art (as Hadrian): Uh hm. 
Austin (as Hisam): I will pass word along to Tabard. 
Art (as Hadrian): Great. Thank you very much. Um, do-
Austin: Throndir, that- that motherfucker just mentioned Tabard. 
Dre: Yeah. Uh hm. 
Austin: Ok. 
Art (as Hadrian): Oh, and do you guys know about Samol?
Austin: Do they even- Yeah, they would know who Samol is, right? Yeah. They say,
Austin (as Hisam): Uh, no. 
Sylvia: Uh, should- hmm. 
Austin: [laughs] You said it now. 
Sylvia: I- I think-
Keith (as Fero): Samol’s death was the precipitative event to magic starting to disappear. 
Sylvia: [makes upset noise] Ephrim looks very upset that that got said out loud. [laughs and breaths emphasis]
Austin (as Hisam): I see. 
Art: Fero just went for it. 
Sylvia: Yep. 
Austin (as Hisam): [exhales] I have much to do. 
[Jack de Quidt’s “Something” begins playing in the background] 
Austin (as Hisam):This is… Ok. Please enjoy your night. 
Art (as Hadrian): Thanks. 
Austin (as Hisam): Tomorrow will be very busy for all of us. 
Austin: Um, and they bow and then they turn to go back to their post. 
Art: Some of us have been busy. I just want to-
Austin: Ok. Great. 
[Music plays out to end]
