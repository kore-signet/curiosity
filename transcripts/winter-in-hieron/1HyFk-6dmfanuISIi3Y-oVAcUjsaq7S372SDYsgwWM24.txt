Takin’ a Snow Day  Transcribed by Steph (@Downsnowing) [1 min 38s] and April(@nbnarwal) [2 min 15s]

AUSTIN: Hey everybody, it’s Austin. Unfortunately, we’re gonna push the episode back this week so that we can make it really good next week. The -- we were kind of moving past the two previous arcs. We had the kind of Rosemerrow arc in the museum, and we had the arc on Old Man’s Chin and Twinbrook. And the next arc is something really special. We’re returning to something we’ve done before and doing it in a -- in a almost a much bigger way in a real sense because we give it the time to breathe. So I really appreciate your patience and hopefully you’ll hear some really great stuff next week. We think you’ll like it a lot. 

So, stay tuned and -- and have a good, warm winter day. If you’re in the part of the world where it’s the winter today. And also if it’s possible to be warm, like, I don’t know, heating bills are expensive so I totally get that. I hope you have blankets if you’re cold or -- or maybe you’re just not in a place where it’s cold at all. Maybe you’re in the -- the Caribbean, I don’t -- I actually don’t know. Is it -- it must still be the Caribbean. I guess, closer to the equator so that’s not -- uhm, hmm. I am not a geologist.

[MUSIC “Inside” begins]

AUSTIN: (slowly) Geologist? (normally) Is that what it is? Is that what a weather person is? A geologist? Or is that a stones person? That’s a -- hmm, what -- hmm. Meteorologist. Meteorologist. (said emphasizing the stressed syllable) Meteorologist. I got there. It took me a little bit, but I got there. Gotta give me credit, I (pause) figured it out in the end. (sigh) See you all next week.

[MUSIC “Inside” ends]

JACK: I’m--I’m--I’m kind of--Yeah, I might save this for when we are recording. Yeah, I’ll save it for when we are recording, and, in lieu of that, I will eat a honey roasted cashew nut.

TABLE FRIENDS: ooohhh~ [laughter] oohh

JANINE: A single one?

[background laughter]

AUSTIN: That sounds good.

JACK: Yeah, just one. Yeah, I didn’t--I’ll eat the second one [ART overlaps] when--when I say.

ART (overlapping JACK): It’s so big, though. This is a cashew nut--[Table Friends laughter] the size of a small dog.

JACK: [soft laughter] Well, they just found the smallest dog in the world, right?

[PAUSE]

ALI: Did they?

JACK: It’s a chihuahua--it’s a chihuahua from Wisconsin. It’s about the size of a tea cup.

ART: I saw a huge cashew.

JACK: uhh. I saw--I saw a link for it earlier. It’s really good, because the video features the teen who’s adopted it. Her dad is just making dad jokes constantly next to her, and she has a look on her face. Like, she wants to just, you know [pause] shatter to a thousand pieces.

[PAUSE]

JACK: Now, I’m searching my history for chihuahua. And we’re gonna see what I get.

[ALI chuckles]

DRE: This--This is the smallest living--This is the smallest dog living by height according (JACK overlaps) to Guinness.

JACK (overlapping DRE): Ah! No, you see, I made a mistake when I said smallest dog ever. When what I should’ve said is--[laughs]

DRE: [laughs] Smallest dog you’ve seen recently.

JACK: No, I should--[laughs] I should’ve said, smallest dog ever adopted from Wisconsin. [laughs]

[Laughter]

ART: Oh, okay, sure.

JACK (laughing): Wisconsin Humane Society.

AUSTIN: Okay.

ART: Wisconsin, a state famous for its small dogs, though.

[Background laughter]

JACK: Uuugh, it’s Thumbelina. It’s a 1.5 pounds.

AUSTIN: What am I looking at? What is this?

JACK: Sorry--[Laughter] I feel--(interrupted by laughter and ART)

ART (interrupting JACK): That’s a small dog! What’re you -

SYLVIA: That’s the shortest dog in the world [overlapped by laughter], Austin.

[Laughter]

JACK starts talking, but AUSTIN interrupts.

AUSTIN: Like, that specific dog.

JACK: No, you see (AUSTIN and ALI overlap) I thought I found the smallest dog in the world, but I actually found the smallest dog ever adopted from Wisconsin Humane Society 

AUSTIN (overlapping JACK) : Yeah, uh-huh.

ALI: [unintelligible]

[Laughter]

KEITH: If--I think it’s a little bit weird that the way that they show you how small the dog is is to put the small dog next to a tall shoe.

[Laughter]

JANINE: Yeah, that thing has a platform.

ALI: Yeah.

JACK: They do one better in-- (ART interrupts)

ART (interrupting JACK): That dog looks huge next to a regular shoe.

JACK (resuming): In-in this video from Wisconsin by putting the dog next to a very big apple.

[Laughter]

JANINE: The dog [transcriber could not understand the word] head, which seems unfair.

AUSTIN: That apple is big. Is that also the biggest apple in Wisconsin?

JACK: It’s the biggest apple ever adopted from the Wisconsin Apple Society.

[Laughter]
