Winter in Hieron 07: Two Hands


Transcriber: Lu

JANINE: Last time, on Friends at the Table.

AUSTIN: You see a crowd beginning to gather. They’re watching, under the light of the sun, a mothman strike the dam with his steel sword. Over, and over, and over again.

AUSTIN (as mothman): We tried trade. They won’t trade, we need to take it. We need a lot- we need a lot. It’s very thirsty.

[pause]

AUSTIN; You see… the cart? That you were escorting? Slowly being rolled away.

 [SONG “Inside” STARTS PLAYING]

ART: I’d like to just grab the back of the cart.

AUSTIN: You hold on to it, and you hear things snapping below the cart. You hear like -You just- by the time you look under, there’s some broken twigs and then...ah, like holes in the ground.

AUSTIN (as Frond): It’s too late.

DRE (as Throndir): What do you mean it’s too late?

AUSTIN: He like, pokes the side of his wound? He’s like… (as Frond:) “Blood doesn’t run.” And then he gives you like a weird bug smile? And seems to be totally okay with the fact that he’s a dead bug… that he’s an undead bug.

JANINE (as Adaire): I gotta… I got a proposition that I think might…. be beneficial.

AUSTIN (as mothman): They’re cruel and we have no interest in trading with them. We want what’s ours, which is the water.

JANINE (as Adaire): Yeah, I can- I think I can arrange that, I think we can sort that out.

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): There’s a glade, north of here. We will meet there, tomorrow, at noon.

ART (as Hadrian): And, the th- and the we in that is, that is the two of us and…

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): A representative. Of Twinbrook.

ART (as Hadrian): Got it…

AUSTIN: You can see it begins pushing itself up with hands, and in the moonlight, the eyes inside of it begin glistening, and the Weaver King pulls itself from its pit. (pause) The moths are like, ecstatic, and one of the many hands reaches out and touches Frond, and like, slowly strokes one of his bent antennae, and puts- another hand pulls out of this huge ball of  twisted flesh …. And rests it on his wound, the one that you gave him that eventually killed him. And when they remove the hand, the wound is healed. (pause)  At this, a number of... holes appear on the ground, all around you, and… twigs start to pop up through, dry, and...uh, dark. And then you see that they’re not twigs but again they're wooden hands. And the snow shakes as people start to crawl towards the Weaver King, all around you.


[“Inside” STOPS PLAYING]


AUSTIN: It’s at about this time, I think, that Red Jack comes over to all of you and says

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): Well huh… I’m surprised to see all of you here...Uh, this is a very special night for the moth people.... You should feel grateful that you can be part of this.

ART (as Hadrian): What’s happening?

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): They’ve been trying to… feed it enough clean water for days and days, months now. It used to be alive and thriving, and then when they dammed the river, it dried up. It’s a... well ah, I’m tempted to say god, but we both know that’s not true, don’t we? [boisterous laugh]

ART (as Hadrian): [humorless/uneasy laugh] Huh...

[Everyone laughs]

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): Umh... but it gives them life, it’s uh.... a relationship between the two. The moths provide for it, and it provides sustenance, and energy. It guided them here, from the woods to the south.

ART(as Hadrian): What will it do now? 

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): [in a somber tone] Oh, well… with the amount of water you provided… it’ll only remain like this for a few hours. And they’ll celebrate… then it’ll slip back to slumber, and they will begin to starve again. Until, they get enough water to feed it, of course. 

DRE (as Throndir): Which means… undoing the dam, right?

AUSTIN: He nods.

JANINE (as Adaire): Eh... y’know, you ca- you can- Undoing is a Strong Word, but we can make adjustments that’ll… It’ll- it’ll be fine, we’ll start that out tomorrow.

AUSTIN: [Art overlaps] He shakes his head.

ART (as Hadrian): [overlapping] Why’d they dam the river to start with?

AUSTIN: Uhm… because people were getting lost down here.

JANINE: Yeah, they’re getting swept away under the ice.

AUSTIN: -swept away under the ice and you couldn't save them.

ART: Oh sure… I remember that now.

AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah… He shakes his head and says uh…

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): [exhales] It won’t be enough.

AUSTIN: He leans in close to you and says

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): I’m not much of a man for mathematics, I didn’t go to school. As it were, they wouldn’t let me in! Can you believe it? [loud laugh]

JANINE: [chuckles]

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): But.. Uh, the outcome is grim, for my friends here and my children…. A little bit of water like this gives them an hour or two to commune, but they need more. Days, weeks, months. Soon it won’t be enough. It needs a steady flow.

DRE (as Throndir): And the people need it to stay alive?

AUSTIN: He nods.

DRE (as Throndir): [confident] Then the dam has to go.

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): Well.... I trust in you to hold those talks, and if the talks fail…

AUSTIN: He like, cracks his knuckles….he has an extra knuckle on each of his hands. His fingers are longer than most people’s fingers? Because-

JANINE: I thought you said his one hand was still a weird bandaged-up nubbin…

AUSTIN: Alright then, he cracks them against his wrist then.
[Ali & Janine laugh]

AUSTIN: He like “CRACK, CRACK...CRACK” I’m trying to do it in real life now...but I just- crack my knuckles or-

ART: [over Austin] Just- do the thing where you- you can crack your knuckles without anything, you just like, pull your fingers down far enough.

AUSTIN: Right, he does that... yeah.

ALI: ‘Cause it’s cooler.

AUSTIN: Yeah,he’s a cool- he’s a cool Oni man.

[Dre laughs]

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): [exhales] Uh… in any case, have you eaten? Good fox here. [boisterous laughter]

DRE (as Throndir): Oh yeah- no, they- Yeah, they’ve pulled that on us.

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): Me too!

JANINE (as Adaire): Was it good?

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): Oh, it’s delicious!

DRE: Uhhhh….

ALI (as Hella): Adaire… nah.

[Janine & Austin laugh]

DRE (as Throndir): Yeah, no- You don’t- you guys probably don’t want the fox.

JANINE: I mean, I’ve eaten fox before… it’s fine-

ALI: -yeah…

JANINE: -they cook it, y’know…

DRE: It’s...it- yeah, the cooking part, that’s kinda the- that’s the dealbreaker…

AUSTIN: Uh-huh.

JANINE: Oh… They do it southern here I see…

[Ali & Austin laugh]

AUSTIN: Perfect. Good. (laughing)

DRE: (laughing) --hey! Hold on!

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): We can provide cots to sleep in, if that’s a thing you need. We recovered some from a recent shipment we intercepted.    

AUSTIN: Uh… Hella, you can tell that he does not like being around you.

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: Like, he won’t look at you in the eye.

ALI: I’m super not into being around him, so it’s fine… [laughs]

ART: Wow, it’s gross here! This people (laughing) --and their gross town…

AUS: Yeah like...as you’re saying all this there are weavers….like, sticky weavers- not sticky, stick-esque weavers, wooden weavers-

ALI: Uhhhhh….[weak laugh]

AUSTIN: -sagging themselves and like, as they move, their branches crack? And break? Like gets brittle- it’s not- and as they get closer to it they hydrate from being near the Weaver King….and then their flesh kinda returns.

ART: Oh my god, this gross things.

AUSTIN: He shakes his head and says

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): It’s the only relief for them. They live in the ground now because to be up here in the air without the flesh is… I understand, painful. Deeply. And so they come out when they can to have a brief repit. A reminder to when they were more complete.

AUSTIN: He shakes his head.

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): I have seen many tragedies... I’ve committed a few (chuckle) But this is… a dire situation.

AUSTIN: And he looks at you Hella, and shakes his head, and says

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): [somber tone] And it’ll only get worse.

ALI: [snorts] --Alright, buddy... [laughs]

AUSTIN: And he walks to go get you- like- he just sets up cots in the field, in the middle of this town for you all. Do you sleep here?

ART: I think- I think Hadrian would probably wanna set up a watch. I don’t wanna-

AUSTIN: Sure.

ALI: --yeah

ART: --I don’t wanna sleep here on… I- I don’t think all of us should be asleep here.

JANINE: Adaire probably sleeps.

[soft laughs]

JANINE: She takes some- She like pulls out her map shit, like a little- like before going to bed she’s like- y’know, near Hadrian’s purple stick-

AUSTIN: Uh-huh.

JANINE: -purple glowy light stick, and like- does a few like notes, a few little night sketches and then she’s like “Ok, ‘night”.

AUSTIN: (laughs) Uh, ok… “When you settle into rest consume a ration, if you’re somewhat- if you’re somewhere dangerous decide the watch order as well. If you have enough XP you may level up. When you wake from at least a few uninterrupted hours of sleep, heal damage equal to half your max HP”

JANINE: Do we have to consume a ration, I thought he was going to bring us snacks.

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: He brings you snacks, you’re good. 

JANINE: [chuckling] Okay...

AUSTIN: He gives you snacks. It’s prepared fox.

DRE: [laughs]

JANINE: It’s fine…

ART: [Austin overlaps] Alright, so… I guess...

AUSTIN: [overlapping] He cooks it! The thing is that like he’s the only one here who can cook because… fire is very dangerous to moths. And dried out weavers, also. 

DRE (as Throndir): Uh... [pause] I can take first watch.

ART (as Hadrian): Great. I’ll go second.

ALI: -yeah.

AUSTIN: Do you commune before or after you sleep?

ART: I need a whole hour to commune?

AUSTIN: You can do that.

ART: Uh, I figured out-- can I commune on watch? It doesn’t say its like…

ALI: (laughs)

AUSTIN: [unintelligible] -well, that means you’re gonna be the one who rolls to watch. Okay, give me a…. Defy danger, wisdom [pause] Actually, do the commune first. Is there a roll for that or it just happens?

ART: I think it just happens, I’m checking.

AUSTIN: [overlapping] It must just happen, yeah.

ART: I need to.. Uh-

AUSTIN: Oh I have it right here. “When you spend an interrupted time, an hour or so, in quiet communing with your deity, you lose any spells already granted to you. You are granted new spells of your choice whose total level doesn’t exceed your own level +1, and none of which is higher than your own level and you prepare all of your rotes which never count against your limit”. So, tell me which spells you- you’re setting up?

10:45 MINUTE MARK

ART: I’m gonna take… “Hold Person”?

AUSTIN: Uh-huh.

ART: and… “Cause Fear”.

AUSTIN: Cool. Good. Uh... then give me Defy Danger, wisdom.

ART: Are you sure you don’t like to pick a stat that I have…?

AUSTIN: Oh, I’m super sure.

[Dre & Ali chuckle]

AUSTIN: Okay… [Dre overlaps] that’s six.

DRE: [overlapping] --use that prep point!

ART: I use that prep point.

AUSTIN: Uhm… What’s the- what’s the preparation that you did to raise it from a six to a seven- like, what do we see a flashback of Hadrian [Art overlaps] having done… to make it better-

ART: [overlapping] Uh, putting some like, dry sticks around the periphery of the camp... 

AUSTIN: Oh, that’s good! I like that. Thats a good tactic-

JANINE: Ohh, good idea.

AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah, that’s a good tactic. So you- it’s not actually your sticks that crack, it’s ones that you hear off in the woods. Uhm… but you rolled a seven which means I have to put you in a tough spot, right?

ART: Sure.

AUSTIN: Uhhh…. [pause] Okay, so… There is- you can hear the heavy boots of a-- you’re like, communing when this happens, and it snaps you out of your communion. You finish it- like, you're fine, you won't lose the spells that you were getting-

ART: Sure.

AUSTIN: [amused] That would be a really good- putting you in a hard spot, in retrospect…

ALI: [laughing]

AUSTIN: Umh… (pause) But instead, you hear the hard snap of a twig out in the woods, and you can tell that it’s coming from an armored foot. And when you look out at the- into the woods, where it came from, you can tell there’s a group of humans who are walking closer. You can get people ready for it, but if you do then… they’ll be discovered too and you’ll have no control over whatever happens to them.

ART: Sure, how- how many moths are near us?

AUSTIN: There are… -y’know, it’s the middle of the night, so they’re wide awake? And doing everyday tasks- at this point, the weaver king has gone back to sleep, is back to being a bundle of twigs in the middle of like, the town. [Art overlaps] The moths-

ART: [overlapping] --sure. Oh, you said we were in a field, are they like, by us?

AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah, yeah- I’m really just imagining a little field, like- it’s probably like a field where- the weavers live underneath it? So it’s like left alone, so the weavers can live there?  And uh… and it’s right next to the buildings of the town.

ART: I shake Hella awake and I turn my- my stick to a brighter color.

AUSTIN: When you do that, that’s when the moths all notice that something is by, and you can hear them buzzing around through the sky. And- like, flying closer to the- the trees, where the people are- but yeah, you can wake up Hella.

ART: Alright.

ALI: I’m awake! I was not sleeping super soundly, so... [laughs]

AUSTIN: [sarcastic tone] Oh, surprise! [pause] Oh, you know- this field would probably actually- so I think that the way this works like- the ecosystem here is the weaver heals and provides sustenance naturally from-- like, secretions or something from- to the moths? And then the moths literally work the fields for the Oni children? And like grow rice and stuff. And the Oni obviously, in the form of Red Jack, protect and provide for the moths. So its a circle of life. So, yeah.  Hella are you- you're probably not in your armor so… things to note.

ALI: [exhales] Umhhh…. Yeah. Okay, sure.

AUSTIN: Just to know.

ALI: I can’t like, put it on?

AUSTIN: You- What type of armor do you have?

ALI: I have… scale mail…?

AUSTIN: You can put on scale- Ooof,  it’s like a big, whole thing. You could do it but- you’ll not be moving for a while-

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: -like, that could be the thing you're doing when these things pop off here in a second.

ALI: Aahhh…. You know what, it’s fine.

AUSTIN: Okay…

ALI: [chuckles]

AUSTIN: Umh….What do you two do? And you don’t wake up Throndir, or Kodiak, or Adaire?

ART: No, I picked who I thought I needed.

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN: Damn! It’s like that!

DRE: [overlapping] Jesus!

JANINE: I see how it is…

AUSTIN: God damn!

ART: I thought time was tight! I’ve go- I got priorities here-

AUSTIN: [overlapping] Uh-huh!

ART: -Hella is a crazy murderer-

ALI: [laughing] What!?

AUSTIN: Okay! This is-

JANINE: [overlapping] So are you!

[Ali laughs]

ART: I know! It’s what I want for this!

[Everyone laughing]

AUSTIN: Good point! Point taken.

ALI: I have my sword… We’re in a hurry…

AUSTIN: So you're just moving to the woods- towards the woods?

ART: Yeah, I wanna see what this is and I wanna stop it if [Austin overlaps] it’s gonna be a problem.

AUSTIN: [overlapping] You- you're about twenty feet away when you hear… Uh, fling hit steel, and the spark light a torch. And then it’s lifted up, and it’s revealed to be the Commision of Smoke and Steel, the Justicier from Ordenna, who raise the torches- their torches up. Umh, and at that point you also just get like, this great shot from like looking upwards into the trees, where there are just, dozens, and dozens, and dozens of the moths, who all shriek at the fire.

ART: Yeah, uh… I need to- I need to- uh, this is not gonna work. I’m gonna try to “I Am the Law” them?

AUSTIN: Okay.

ALI: Oh, boy…

AUSTIN: What do you say?

ART: I’m trying to work out the speech that I think is going to impress ordennans based on my divine authority.

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN: [amused] Good luck! [pause] I mean, you definitely had a talk that was sort of like- you had a talk with uh… with Tavira Shal who kind of… agreed that you were loosely aligned. And you represent a law, they represent a law, soon enough- soon enough your law will be their law anyway! Or the other way around, their law will be your law.

ART: Yeah, we’ll see how that goes! [laughs]

ALI: Can I- can I aid?

AUSTIN: Yeah, tot- well- yeah, totally.

ALI: Umh… yeah just in- yeah, in just, assisting-

ART: [overlapping] I think just standing next to me would be helpful.

ALI: Right…

AUSTIN: Yeah.

ALI: But also be like- you know, we don’t have to- this not have to go to ten right now.

AUSTIN: Yeah. Okay, you- that’s what you say? 

ALI: [laughs]

AUSTIN: Okay. Gimme your- your talk- let me hear Hadrian, let me hear how Hella adds on to it.

ART (as Hadrian): I am Hadrian, paladin of Samothes. You- we met this morning. Put your torches down, you're scaring them. 

ART: That’s all I want, I want the- put the torches down, I want them to talk to me about this.

AUSTIN: Uh-huh [Ali laughs] Gimme the roll.

ALI: Uh- Should I roll first?

AUSTIN: Actually, yeah, yeah, sorry, Hella should roll first, and what do you do? How do you add on to that, Hella?

ALI: Uh, could I like- putting up my hands and being like- yeah, this doesn’t happen to have- have to happen right here, [amused] like this.

AUSTIN: Okay. Gimme the roll.

ALI: That’s a 10.

AUSTIN: There’s- It’s a ten, so, +1.

ALI: [amused] Very supportive.

AUSTIN: That’s a ten! Nice work! Alright, so they have to do what you say, or attack you-

ART: -or flee? And I get a +1 forward, on this here.

AUSTIN: [pause] Alright so, I think… Porto Porlo Pinta flees. He’s like, at seeing the giant moths, and you saying that, it’s just too much? And he just drops his torch into the snow... uh, and then like you can hear him as his armor ‘clinks and clanks’, and he runs back towards Twinbrook. Umhhh…. Avora, Maria, and Stornras… put out their- actually, no, I think Tavira, Stornras and Maria put out their torches at your command, but Avora Gental, who’s the kinda shitty- like, not just mean, but kinda like snooty- of the justicier, scoffs at you? Uh, and says- and draws *his[their] blade and steps forward... and says

AUSTIN (as Avora): [dragging the words] What have we decided to call you- the Queenkiller? Huh?

ALI (as Hella): That’s one of them- I mean you said you would think about [Austin overlaps] it for a little bit.

AUSTIN: [overlapping] Yeah, but it’s been busy- I’ve been busy, I mean- we’re recording way earlier than I thought we would be again [Ali overalps], so. I didn’t have time to-

ALI: [overlapping] It was the- the-

AUSTIN: The Regicide-

ALI: Yeah

AUSTIN: Yeah, the Queenkiller, the Regicide, the- something else probably too. Uhm, and- they say… uhh, Avora says- spits on the ground in front of you, as is customary at this point, and says

AUSTIN (as Avora): The Queenkiller is a coward! And a friend to the unholy. They’ll give me a title for this!

AUSTIN: And charges at you both. *He’s[They’re] focusing on Hadrian first, what do you do Hadrian?

ART: Sure. Uh, I Hack and Slash?

AUSTIN: Okay. So you’re just like, bring it in, and then counter attack?

ART: Yeah

AUSTIN: You both have swords, so you don’t need to Defy Danger or anything like that to be in a melee with him- or, sorry, with them. Uh, gimme a roll. [pause] That is a 10! So you can deal your damage and not get hit or you can do an additional 1d6 on top of the damage you’d have- already do. 

ART: Uhm… I’ll do damage and not get hit, I’m on a quest so I get an additional 1d4.

AUSTIN: Oof… good, do it. [pause] So it’s 5, plus…?

ART: And then… 

AUSTIN: 2! so it’s 7. Ah, they have 1 armor, so you do 6. What do you do? What does this look like? As they run in with you- run into you with a sword

ART: *He’s[they’re] running into me with a sword? Umh. … huh. I think Hadrian’s just- is kinda, y’know, he wasn’t super ready for this, he was busy, so he kinda “brute-forces” his way through this?

AUSTIN: [amused] Okay.

ART: *He’s charging, *he’s gonna swing his sword, Hadrian just kinda like, puts his off-hand and just like, bumps *him at the elbow? And then stabs.

AUSTIN: Alright. The blade pierces through the side of the- Avora’s armor and like, goes through the side of the stomach. And -[gasp] like, deep breath and then like, falls off of your blade, and is coughing on the ground as blood spills out into the moonlit snow. Umh… Tavira, who is the leader of this group, sighs and shakes her head. And says

AUSTIN (as Tavira): Stornras, gather him.

AUSTIN: And Stornras, who is the big, burly- kinda attendant to this group, but is not actually a justicier himself, goes and- like, kinda gestures like “okay, you're not gonna fuck me up either, right?” [Ali laughs] and just shakes his big head and is just like- “What the fuck am I doing”, basically. Jim Halpert looks all around. Umh… grabs Avora by the leg and begins pulling them back towards- towards the group... as they cough from the ground. At this point the moths have all- like, a lot of them have landed in a circle around your group? Uh, and Red Jack kinda stumbles out- I think you all- I think at this point the whole group can be awake. Throndir and Adaire are probably wide awake at this point- not wide awake, but have woken. And Red Jack is like

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): [yawning] 

AUSTIN: He cracks his back…

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): What is going on? [threatening] I thought I could trust you. You gave me your word.

ART: Who’s he talking to?

AUSTIN: You. Hadrian and Adaire.

JANINE (as Adaire): Well, they-- [laughs] Okay, I’m sorry. you can, because we clearly stopped some sort of fucking... ordennan goddamn takeover. So just relax…[Austin overlaps] Everything’s fine still…

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): [overlapping] Why are they here?

JANINE (as Adaire): Good question! Maybe they followed the car tracks you left.

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): I was very careful.

JANINE (as Adaire): You were drinking and riding a horse with a cart behind you.

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): [amused] Yes, but I only started drinking towards the end of the trip! Ah, ha, ha!

[Everyone laughing]

JANINE: [amused] That was an in-character laugh.

AUSTIN: Right, good… He nods at them, and says

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): Why do you come here? You're not welcome. We’ve seen your ships. Your smoke. 

AUSTIN: And… Tavira- [pause] God, she- like undoes a glove and kneels down next to… ah- Avora, who’s dying. And like, checks their pulse, and shakes her head and stands up and says

AUSTIN (as Tavira): We sens- we sensed the sin here. The curse. We sense Nacre.

JANINE (as Adaire): Sin is just a fun name for a thing you don’t like.

AUSTIN (as Tavira): Sin is taking over Hieron. You can pretend it doesn’t exist, or you can do what we do, which is face it. Bring us your undead. That is the offer we make, or we’ll return by light, and you will not be able to resist us.

ALI: Do I have any understanding of… Uh, Frond like, being healed?  Or like, resurrected?

AUSTIN: Umhh…. No, only Hadrian and Throndir do.

ALI: Okay. Maybe one of you can say [laughing] something about that!

ART: I don’t- I dont understand this wasn’t like- I don’t know what these things do.

AUSTIN:  Right- you don’t understand the curse at all, right?

ART: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Like- again, the open story about this is- Ordenna believes, and has some degree of at least rhetorically strong argument that there is a curse spreading through Hieron. And that it is a curse of the undead? That some people that should be dying are not dying? And that goes against the natural order, and that goes against progress. That in order for us to- y’know, continue to advance as a culture, we can’t just let the undead walk around. The dead need to die, because they are- I mean, depends on who you’re talking to in Ordenna, some people make like a very utilitarian “drain on the resources” argument that doesn’t always hold up super well? Other people make a religious argument, other people make a- just like, it is not natural to have people who are alive anymore? Like people- it’s a natural right to die when you’re supposed to die. Which is maybe a little more convincing, depending on what your morals are? [Ali chuckles] So that’s like the- the kind of argument that they’ve been making… most of you haven’t just seen the undead though. Only one of you in this party has directly encountered the undead before.

ALI: Right.

AUSTIN: Yeah- that’s not true. That’s not true! Ah, Hadrian has killed an undead thing too. The dwarf. The dwarf skeleton. [scoff]

ART: Oh, sure. But there’s no skeletons here.

AUSTIN: She goes

AUSTIN (as Tavira): [scoff] Insects don’t have skeletons, paladin. 

JANINE (as Adaire): They do, they’re on the outside.

[Dre laughs]

AUSTIN (as Tavira): Ye- yes I [Janine overlaps] understand that. Hm...

JANINE: [overlapping] They’re still kinda- well then you shouldn’t have said what you said, ‘cause it was so mean [laughing]. 

AUSTIN (as Tavira): They’re not skeletons, they’re- [struggling with words]

JANINE (as Adaire): They’re called exoskeletons, literally.

AUSTIN (as Tavira): Right but not skeletons, it’s not just skeletons. We don’t call them inter-skeletons.

[Janine chuckles]

AUSTIN: Anyway-

ART: Well that wouldn’t be right either--

[Dre and Janine laugh]

ART (as Hadrian): Anyway! Show me what you're talking about.

JANINE (as Adaire): Yeah, show us an un- an undead. ‘Cause this people all look pretty... lively to me? I don’t know.

AUSTIN: Stornras... he sighs, and he steps on the neck of Avora, who gasps. And then, [gasp] -doesn’t die, even though, with a broken neck, they should definitely be dead. 

JANINE (as Adaire): Okay- [Austin overlaps] well, l see- but- but you brought them here…

AUSTIN: Tavira says- ah, Tavira says-

AUSTIN (as Tavira): [harshly] This land is cursed. I should raze this entire place. I can smell the sin here. But if you give me those who are cursed, we will leave. With them. 

AUSTIN: And then she draws her blade of ordennan steel, and puts it through Avora’s chest. And Avora like, completely deflates- well, not completely deflates, but the life- the unlife leaves their body.

ART: That didn’t really answer my question...uh [laughs] Hadrian like gives a sidelong look to Hella?

[Ali laughs]

ALI (as Hella): [long breath] I mean, they’re right.

AUSTIN: There it is.

ART (as Hadrian): Huh?

ALI (as Hella): Look, what happened in Nacre shouldn’t spread. I was there. They- they’re doing good work.

ART: I look at Jack?

AUSTIN: He shakes his head, and he says

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): I told you about her. She’s aligned with the dark.

ART (as Hadrian): I don’t know about where you come from, but where I come from the people tryna put zombies in the crowd... aren’t the dark ones.

JANINE (as Adaire): Yeah, the people trying to raze villages usually are, though.

ART: [mumbling] A village of zombies is really hard to-

[Ali laughs]

ALI (as Hella): Adaire, you don’t understand how dangerous this is.

AUSTIN: Throndir, what are you-  like, as someone close to the natural world- what do you come down, on all of this.

DRE: I’m actually- I’m trying to think about that, because- I mean, I’m- like, literally my alignment is “Freeing people from literal or figurative bonds”. And, in death as a…. -In some ways [Austin’s agreement noises] freeing a bond. But is... also unlife. 

AUSTIN: Right.

DRE: [laughs] Freeing bonds! [pause] I think- I think that, for Throndir, it’s more confound to like- this are people who like, whether or not the morality argument of like- whether they’re unnatural or whatever, they’re just people, who haven’t hurt anybody or anything.

AUSTIN: Does he make that case?

DRE: Yeah.

AUSTIN: --or does he keep- Okay.

ART: Y’know who I bet knows what I should do. 

[chuckling]

AUSTIN: [amused] Who is that?

ART: Samothes!

[Everyone laughs]

AUSTIN: How do you- What are you gonna do to talk to Samothes?

ART: I’m gonna cast Guidance, one of my rotes?

AUSTIN: Uh-huh

ART: And he can direct me towards the course of action he would have me take. And then disappear.

[laughing]

ART: It literally says “then disappears”, he isn’t hanging out.

AUSTIN: [laughing] It really says that, huh!

ARt: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Huh. Weird.

ART: You don’t get to just chill with Samothes all day for making one wisdom roll, for a 0 level spell, come on guys.

[laughter continues]

AUSTIN: Alright. [pause] Oh, there’s a 5....

DRE: Uh-huh!

ART: It didn’t go great.

AUSTIN: No… no it didn’t.

ART: I have- I have 2 more of those points, can I use both of them here?

AUSTIN: [amused] No, you can only use one for roll, we established that. [deep breath]

ART: Well… [Janine overlaps] fuck me up then, I don’t know what to tell you.

JANINE: [overlapping] Can someone like, aid him?

AUSTIN: No, you have to aid ahead of time.

JANINE: [concerned noises]

30:20 MINUTE MARK

AUSTIN: You have to aid and it opens you up. Umh-

ART: What happens if you- what happens if you fail a spell?

AUSTIN: I get to make a move as hard as I want.

[Ali laughs knowingly]

AUSTIN: That’s always what- [Art overlaps]

ART: I do not- it is not like, specific…

AUSTIN: So the last time you failed one of these rolls, the… ring around your neck fell off. And- that was actually a-- an almost-success, right?

ART: [Austin overlaps] Yeah that was-

AUSTIN: [overlapping] Yeah, take XP- take XP [pause] Umh… God, uhhh. So what’s the asking for guidance look like?

ART: Umh, I think it’s kinda like- just like, a looking towards the heavens, it’s like a- It’s looking up and putting your palms up, it’s kinda like… Outside of a religious significance it would look kinda ridiculous. Honestly, it’d just be like “huh?” 

[Janine laughs]

ART: You can’t see me, this doesn’t make any sense.

[pause]

AUSTIN: The… [pause] it’s odd timing. You look up just in time to see Bri, the smaller of the two moons, pass directly in front of Del, the larger one. You’re spotting a- ah, a lunar eclipse, where the actual thing eclipsing itself is the two moons. Ah-

ART: Sure.

AUSTIN: And… then the third shadow appears over, and both moons, and Hieron, move into alignment. And if you thought things were dark before- now it is completely black.

ART: Alright, a triple eclipse…

[breathy laughs]

AUSTIN: It is, the- it’s the darkest you've ever seen. it’s darker than it’s ever been in your life, [Song “Eve's Light Parade” starts playing] in the deepest caverns that you've traveled into, on the end of the lunar cycles, when- when the moons are naturally gone. It’s never been this dark. And the strange thing is, the stars are brighter and clearer than they’ve ever been before- and I don’t just mean they’re brighter because the moons are gone, and so there’s nothing to relate them to- they seem to shine more brightly. And not just that, you can distinguish each one from the other, clearly. You can- you can see where one ends and one begins, when normally they’re just a blur- it’s almost as if some are further away and, you can sense that distance, and others are a little nearer. [pause] Some of them pulse, and glow, and... there is something heavenly about them. And I don’t know that anyone even has a notion of what heavenly means in this world. uhm… And the weird thing, about all that, is that despite the fact that they’re brighter… it’s like the brightness is kept to themselves. It’s like the stars hold close their own brightness, and have none of it to share with anyone else, because it’s not any easier to see by that starlight. It’s just dark.

[“Eve's Light Parade” stops playing]

AUSTIN: And I don’t know that you have the time to... work through all of that, because it’s about then that you hear the steel come out.

ART: Uh, the steel come out from where?

[loud laughter]

AUSTIN: It’s completely- ugh, good question!

ART: I still have m- I got a torch, still.

AUSTIN: Do you light it?

ART: --like a lightstick. It’s- It goes until I dismiss it.

AUSTIN: Uh, but you communed, when you commune you- you have to dism- you have to- you lose all your spells when you commune? So you have to recast it.

ART: Oh, shit, I have to re-

AUSTIN: Yeah.

ART: [pause] I mean, sure, what- I mean, I just failed two spell rolls in a row, [incomprehensible]

[Janine laughs]

AUSTIN: Sh- [Art overlaps]

ART: --it’s basically 0.

AUSTIN: Uh-huh. That’s a success! Do you- what do you do? Do you, uh… you rolled an 8, so, do you lose the spell, you take minus one forward [Art overlaps]

ART: I’ll lose the spell, It’s gonna be day soon.

AUSTIN: Okay.

ART: Probably.

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN: Hm. Is it?

[concerned noises]

AUSTIN: Uh… the, uh- [laughs] The spell flickers on, you're doing the purple light again?

ART: Yeah

AUSTIN: Okay. Uhm, I think it takes a few- like, it flickers on. It doesn't just turn on right away. And thats like- when you've realized you've lost it? It’s like- it doesn't come right back on, and again, it- Samothes is not pleased with the notion of you not using his true light. And in the flickering you can see the justicier cutting through a number of the moths, as they begin to try to like, find egress safely away? Uhm… but they've very quickly killed a bunch of them. Uhm… and uh, among the people cut is Red Jack. And he’s coughing blood, as Tavira and the others escape. You can hear horses whining in the distance, as they go to meet their riders. 

AUSTIN: [pause] What do you do? The moths are furious and are like- going all over the place, and are chasing after them. You can hear some of the crackling of weavers, trying to get themselves out of the ground, and chase them down through the woods? Uhm, and at that point one of the justicier lights their torch again.

ART: I go and shove them.

AUSTIN: I mean- they're like, running away from you, so you have to chase them down at this point.

ART: Alright!

AUSTIN: Gimme a- [Dre says something] Gimme a- Go ahead! What's up Throndir?

DRE: I was gonna say I take off running. Uhm, and using my animal speech I call for Ace.

AUSTIN: Oh, nice!

JANINE: Oooh….

AUSTIN: Give me a… there’s a roll for that, isn't there?

DRE: For the- the ability itself?

AUSTIN: Yeah, there’s not for like calling an animal to do a thing with you?

DRE: Uhm… I mean, there is-

AUSTIN:  There is for hunting.

DRE: Yeah… 

AUSTIN: Uh…[Dre overlaps] Well, I like the way you do it, it’s cool.

DRE: [overlapping] I mean, basically the way that like, my animal stuff works is just- y’know, it like, works in concert with whatever moves I’d make.

AUSTIN: Oh yes, give me a Defy Danger d- uh, charisma.

DRE: Okay. Oh, boy…

AUSTIN: You can’t just call for someone else’s-

DRE: Yeah, no, that’s- no, that’s fair. That’s absolutely fair.

[pause]

DRE: Whoa!

AUSTIN: Oh, look at that 11! [Dre overlaps] You wouldn’t make it in one, and you rolled-

DRE: [overlapping] That’s with a -1! [laughing]

AUSTIN: Alright! Give me your best “yell for Ace”.

DRE: [laughing] Umh.. I think like, it’s as Throndir takes off running he sees Red Jack like…. I mean, how bad is he? Is he like bleeding out?

AUSTIN: Oh, he’s like bleeding out, it’s not good.

DRE: Uhm… Then I think like, maybe Throndir even locks eyes with him? 

AUSTIN: [amused] He gives you a nod.

DRE: [laughing] Yeah, and as he does, like- Throndir just shouts “Ace, to me!” 

AUSTIN: Gimme a real- Gimme a fucking yell.

DRE: [laughing] I have people asleep above me! It’s 11 o’clock!

[loud laughing]

AUSTIN: Fine, Fine… [exhales] Fine…

DRE: We can do it in post, tomorrow.

AUSTIN: We’ll do it in post, yeah, sold. Pop that right in.

ALI: Oh, speaking of post, what uh... what- [laughing] You just- see, what kind of dog Throndir is.

DRE: Oh, shit, yeah. What kind dog Throndir is? [Austin overlaps] He’s a-

AUSTIN: [Overlapping] Excuse me?? What kind of dog- ??

[Ali & Austin laughing]

DRE: He’s a- a real DAWG. 

[laughter intensifies]

DRE: [spelling] D.A.W.G

ALI: [laughing] You got Kodiak’s breed wrong. In the- [Dre overlaps]

DRE: [overlapping] Yeah, no, I did. In the last episode.

ALI: -In the first episode.

DRE: Yeah, no, I said he was a… I think I said he was an English Mastiff? But he’s a Tibetan Mastiff, which is literally the biggest dog in the world.

AUSTIN: Wow.

ALI: It’s an important difference, because one is so much fluffier than the other.

DRE: Yeah.

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN: Okay. That’s fair. Uh, alright. [pause] Yeah, so you're on Ace now, Ace lifts you up as you're chasing after these other-

ART: Ohhhh!

AUSTIN: Uhm...

ART: [in awe] Look how fluffy this dog is!

[Dre & Ali laugh]

AUSTIN: Alright, link me to this dog, I need to see this dog. Someone link me to the dog. What is it, a Tibetan Mastiff?

DRE: Yeah.

[typing noises]

AUSTIN: OH MY GOD!

[burst of laughter]

AUSTIN: Look at this buddy!

ALI: [lovingly] They're all so big and so fluffy.

[everyone talking over each other]

AUSTIN: What does this- what is this Youtube image- [laughing]

ART: It can't be real, there's no way it’s bigger than that one man-

[more loud laughing]

AUSTIN: [laughing] If we add podcast- alright, this should be our podcast for this week! [pause] This is a good image! It’s so fake and bad!

[soft laughing]

AUSTIN: Oh my god… it’s a cool dog, though. I love it. So mu- Oh boy, look how fierce it can get! [pause] Who’s that big man?

[they’re STILL LAUGHING]

AUSTIN: Umh. Lord, okay. Deep breaths. Deep breaths. Uhm…. Okay, you're up on that horse, riding after the ones who are getting away... ah, Hadrian, I want you to do a run if you're gonna try to catch the guy who’s about to throw down the- the torch.

ART: Yeah, I wanna tackle, but I don’t think it’s gonna help? Very much?

AUSTIN: Okay.

ART: I- I’m tackling the guy who’s trying to put his torch on the ground, but-

AUSTIN: Yeah…. It’s not gonna help much.

DRE: I mean, if it hits [Art overlaps] the snow…

ART: [overlapping] It’s my idea, I’m gonna stick with it...

AUSTIN: Yeah, I’ll- give me the roll- give me the roll.

ART: Uhm… is what?

AUSTIN: Uh… what’s your goal? It’s just to catch him*[her] and tackle him*?

ART: Yeah, I wanna get him* on the ground.

AUSTIN: Hm- you can- you can do strength. Yeah. [pause] Uh, you catch him*, and tackle him*, and like the-- you do it quickly enough that you can extinguish the flame, before it hits any of the crackly weavers, any of the- the [exhales] whatever I've written their names as…

ART: Do I deal damage? Is this a-

AUSTIN: Uh, no, this was a Defy Danger, this wasn’t a- the danger was, if you failed… uh-oh! Things go bad. [pause] Oh, right, the dry ones I've called ‘kindling’ in my notes. So really good that you stopped the fire. Adaire and Hella what are you doing?

[long silence]

ALI: Uh…

AUSTIN: Uh, Red Jack is bleeding out.

ALI: Uh- Who’d- Ugh…

JANINE: I bet Hella’s not… [laughing] terribly concerned about that, probably…

ALI: Yeah...What’s the- so who- so… the ordennans are fighting the moths?

AUSTIN: They’re just fighting for a way out, and also, yeah.

ALI: Okay…

AUSTIN: ‘Cause they’ve been- It’s kind of a surround by the moths, and then there was this moment of darkness, and they struck, as soon it- as soon as it happened.

ALI: Okay… [soft breath]

JANINE: That… tree only heals moths, right?

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN: I- You would need a lot of water to bring it back, and I don’t think you have it.

JANINE: Yeah…

AUSTIN: You could try to- you could try to heal him?

JANINE: I could… [soft laugh] uh, what would that be?

AUSTIN: It depends on [Janine overlaps] what you want to do...

JANINE: [overlapping] Would I have to- I have to like, look around- okay, could- okay. Okay. 

AUSTIN: Uh-huh?

JANINE: I can like, look around for th- Were there-- there weren’t tents, but there were [Austin overlaps] kites?

AUSTIN: [overlapping] No…[pause] there were kites. 

JANINE: What are the kites made of?

AUSTIN: Oh, you just have the- you have the cart! The cart had some medical stuff in it, that's part of why- [Janine overlaps] As a hireling, he has stuff. So yeah, you can totally have gauze, and sutures, and some cleaning alcohol. 

JANINE: [overlapping] Oh, well then- Okay. So Adaire is going to get that stuff. Uh… what should I…?

AUSTIN: Yeah, what should you roll, right? It’d be- I think it’s probably another Defy Danger, the danger is that it gets way worse. Uhm, you tell me. Is this Int? Is this Dex? Is this about acting quickly? Is it about applying it carefully? But I think it’s Dex or Int.

JANINE: Uh….

AUSTIN: [amused] It ain’t charisma, y- you're not gonna talk him into not being bloody.

JANINE: I’m gonna say acting fast is more relevant than quick thinking, ‘cause there’s bandages in the cart, it’s a pretty straightforward line of thought.

AUSTIN: Yeah, totally. So give me a [Janine overlaps] Defy-

Janine: [overlapping] Also I have a one on Dex and not on Int! So!

AUSTIN: Hella are you helping at all? You're just gonna let- you gonna- deal with some other shit.

ALI: Yeah, if I’m being like… the most honest that I can about this, I think that like, when the- the light went out? Hella also draws her sword.

AUSTIN: Oh, shit. Okay. 

ALI: [laughing] like-

AUSTIN: Oooh, really. Is that what happened? [pause] Gimme a roll.

ALI: [deep breath] Oh, lord in heaven…[laughs]

AUSTIN: Uhm… if that's what you did- I don't know about all that. Uh… give me an Heirloom roll.

ALI: Oh, sure… Alright, yeah. Uh, what’s that?

AUSTIN: That’s charisma!

ALI: That’s charisma! [sarcastic] Man, I have a bunch of that.

AUSTIN: [hesitant] Hm… Yeah, you have an alright charisma!

ALI: [sound of pain]

AUSTIN: -But that's a 6! 

ALI: [sigh & more sounds of pain]

AUSTIN: You have preparation still, right? You could-

JANINE: -Yeah…

AUSTIN: [Ali overlaps] You could get that up to a 7.

ALI: The final prep to get that up to a seven- but there won’t be XP… Nah that’s fine

AUSTIN: Okay.

ALI: I’ll use it, to get it to 7.

AUSTIN: Uh, “When you consult the spirits that reside in your signature weapon, they’ll give you an insight relating to the current situation, and might ask you some questions in return. Roll + charisma. On a 10+, the GM will give you good detail. On a 7-9, the GM will give you an impression.” Uhm…. when you draw your blade, you catch like the last little bit of the moonlight as it- as it gets like,  caught away? And it holds in place on your blade? Your blade glows, for a half of a second. Like it’s- it’s…. Uh, it is a- a little bit of light, for this one moment, and you- you’re- it catches your eye, because it doesn’t look like its made of steel, it looks like it’s made of glass. It looks like it’s- it’s a window pane. And, as it- you kinda like, see Red Jack through the glass. You see that behind him- he’s not in the woods, in the snow, he is in a field, in- outside of a castle that's on a hill. And he’s on Ace, and he’s- he looks like he’s a big grinning mass like he always looks. And there are people in the fields behind him… uhm, and people are waving and celebrating. And, just like, that it closes. The blade returns to its steel. And instead of being happy and smiling, Red Jack is coughing up blood, and is uh... not so happy. [pause] Throndir. You're on a horse [Janine overlaps] chasing down these-

JANINE: [overlapping] Wait a min- I haven't… rolled the heal-

AUSTIN: Yeah, we’ll come back to you. I wanted to move back to- high speed. You can't just stay in low… it’s-- loud-quiet-loud.

[Janine laughs]

45:00 MINUTE MARK

AUSTIN: C’mon

[Dre laughs]

AUSTIN: So, loud. There's a horse race happening.

DRE: How many people am I chasing?

AUSTIN: Two.

DRE: Okay.

AUSTIN: One is dead- Or, three. Stornras, Tavira and…. Oh, no, no, ‘cause Porlo Pint- Porlo… Pinta left already.

DRE: He ran off, yeah.

AUSTIN: So yeah, it’s Tavira and Stornras. Uhm, who are on horses. So, what are you trying to do, are you trying to catch up with them?

DRE: Uhm… I think what I want to do is I want to disable their horses.

AUSTIN: Okay. Is there like a bow shot? Are you shooting a bow from the back of a horse?

DRE: Yes.

AUSTIN: give me… I think that’s- you have to do a Defy Danger to- to… Or- yeah, you have to do a Defy Danger to be able to do that. Otherwise you're gonna lose control of this horse.

DRE: Yeah… is that just- is that Dex?

AUSTIN: Uhm… it’s either Dex or…. Charisma? Depending on if- like, how you're guiding it, right? Are you like “Alright buddy, hold still” or are you forcing it to do something? By like, pulling on its reins. And keeping it like- like, are you treating it like a friend or like an animal.

DRE: I think I’m treating it… I mean, in character treating it more like a friend.

AUSTIN: Well, that’s a charisma roll.

DRE: Okay. Probably gonna- well, we’ll see.

AUSTIN: [laughs] How’s your prep doing?

DRE: Oh, boy! It doesn’t matter, ‘cause that’s 5.

AUSTIN: Oh, that’s a 5… uhm… Alright so, you get- you just like try to line up the shot, and Ace is going as hard as it can, and I- Ace respects you, for being nice to it? Which it’s why it stops. Because it notices that the- the other horses have left a trap in front of you. They've dropped caltrops, as they've been fleeing? And so, it like bucks, and tosses you off the horse- off of it, before it runs into the caltrops, where it would've gotten really bad, really quickly? But that means that you only have one shot to fire at them. You won’t be able to keep up the chase after this

DRE: Okay…

AUSTIN: So you can give me a Volley? Ah, or a Called Shot- oh, not a Called Shot, they know that you're there. Uhm, so yeah, you can give me a Volley to try to shoot them.

DRE: [quietly] Okay.

AUSTIN: Which one are you aiming at? Stornras or Tavira?

DRE: Uhm… Which one is the leader? Tavira?

AUSTIN: Tavira. Yeah, she’s the- she’s the leader.

DRE: That’s a 12!

AUSTIN: There’s a 12! “When you take aim and shoot, deal damage. At a 10+ you have a clear shot and deal your damage. On a 7-9, etcetera- but you can deal your damage.

DRE: [kinda disappointed] That's 2.

AUSTIN: That’s 2. The arrow like- you said you're aiming at the horse and not her, right? 

DRE: Yeah…

AUSTIN: She’s still the leader. Uhm, I think the- it gets in under the horses armor, but it doesn't stop her. It does hurt the horse? And there will be like, a trail of blood away- uhm, if you wanted to track her or something? But it doesn't quite stop them. And they retreat, safely

DRE: Is uh- did Ace run into the caltrops…?

AUSTIN: No no no, Ace stopped. Ace stopped.

DRE: Okay, that’s-

AUSTIN: threw- bucked, threw you off, and then like- watches you get up, take the shot and like, [amused] hit, but not get what you want? And then Ace goes like [neighs] and nuzzles you. And then like, wags its head back towards the town. Old Man’s Chin, not Twinbrook.

DRE: Yeah, okay. I- I guess i hop back on and then ride back to town.

AUSTIN: Alright. On your way back- while you're on your way back, while 
Hadrian has this guy pinned, while Hella is trying to figure out what the fuck she’s doing…

[Ali chuckles]

AUSTIN: --Adaire. Give me that… that Dex roll.

JANINE: I’m gonna give you that Dex roll…

AUSTIN: Defy Danger. [long hiss] Oh!

JANINE: I’m gonna spend the prep.

AUSTIN: Okay… uhm-

JANINE: And get my 7…

AUSTIN: So you get a 7. Uh… let's see. Let me look at your sheet real quick. Uhm…[pause] You can- you can totally stabilize him? But it means using the oil that you have- the oil of Tagit. You won’t have that available anymore. You have like- he is in too much pain? So you have to knock him out in order to- to do the surgery on him, basically. Otherwise he won't stay still enough for you to suture up the wounds, and clean them out.

JANINE: Okay, that’s totally cool, yeah.

AUSTIN: Yeah. So yeah, you- that's what you do-

JANINE: She would probably even reach for that naturally. 

AUSTIN: Yeah, totally. But you- you use it up, you don't have it anymore.

JANINE: Yeah. yeah-

AUSTIN: You have to like, get back to a-

JANINE: I mean he’s a big dude, he drinks a lot, he needs- y’know…

[Ali & Dre laugh]

AUSTIN: [laughing] Yeah- In fact, you start to put it on him, and he’s like “no no no no No” and just grabs it from [Janine laughs] and drinks it. [pause] And yeah, you're able to stabilize him. Uhm… And it stays dark, all night. And then the morning. What are all of you doing?

ART: Am I just… sitting on this guy?

AUSTIN: Oh yeah, you can arrest that guy or whatever. What are you doing with that dude? That is a… what's that class thing-

ART: I don’t know…

AUSTIN: Let's see. I always forget- just let me look at my notes, that's all. That is… not Sid Half-Off. Uhm…

[snicker]

AUSTIN: The other- oh sorry, that's not the guy! That's Maria! That’s Maria Velasina.

ART: Uhm… I guess- I guess…. Uh, I’ve a couple metaphysical questions for you.

AUSTIN: Sure.

ART: Would you…-Is this- is this, has this yet escalated to evil creature? 

AUSTIN: Maria?

ART: Yeah.

AUSTIN: No…

ART: Really? She’s kinda out here committing genocide, I don’t wanna say-

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN: She’s killing the undead!

ART: And a lot on non-undead!

AUSTIN: How do you know?

ART: These are all undead?

AUSTIN: I don’t know! She’s not evil.

ART: Okay, is she a criminal?

AUSTIN: Whose law is it that you're following? ‘Cause that's a good question.

ART: Whose law has jurisdiction here?

AUSTIN: I mean, is that- is that  how you hold the belief? Is that how you believe Samothes holds the belief?

ART: No. I guess- I guess not. What does Samothes think? [Austin overlaps] What does- what are the law- what does my holy book say?

AUSTIN: [overlapping] What do you think- What does your holy book say? You tell me. Consult your book- like, you tell me what Hadrian thinks is the law.

ART: Hm… I mean that’s a- [Austin overlaps]

AUSTIN: [overlapping] You tell me one-

[talking over each other, indistinguishable]

AUSTIN: Out of character, you tell me what the law is, and then two, what does Hadrian think the law is.

ART: I’m 100% sure the law the law allows for killing undead creatures. [Austin overlaps] You know this, ‘cause of that time I did that. 

AUSTIN: [overlapping] I’d hope so, given your history!

[Austin and Janine laughing]

ART: I don’t know that Hadrian believes these are all undead creatures.

AUSTIN: okay.

ART: At that point it is against the law.

AUSTIN: Is it against the law to kill those who harbor the undead? Or- or the evil, or the supernatural or whatever? The unholy? ‘Cause they're making a distinction here that maybe you're not, which is- they're not saying that they’re evil, they're saying that they're unnatural. Uhm… right? Like, that's the distinction that the- that Ordenna is making here. They don't care that they're not evil. Like, they're not in this about evil, they're in this about safety, they're in this about what is natural, or good, and what is it that supports the growth of- the recovery of Hieron. Which is an important distinction, so- so, like, you saying “nothing here is evil” does not counter them saying “yeah, but it’s unnatural”.

ART: [quietly] Was that skeleton man evil?

AUSTIN: I don’t think so.

ART: [mumbling] -check the tapes.

[Ali and Austin laughing]

ART: She's certainly an unbeliever.

AUSTIN: Funny thing. [pause] You know how I said her last name is Velasina?

ART: Yeah…

AUSTIN: It means “Little Velas”. She's from Velas. She joined Ordenna. She's a family of Velisians who moved there. Uhm… she probably has a connection to the church directly. Do you talk to her at all? Do you- did you knock her out?

ART: No, I think I just tackled her, I think my question is… I think I- I’m holding her down and hold an armored fist up. And I say

ART (as Hadrian): Tell me what you believe.

[pause]

AUSTIN: Uh… give me a Parlay. The leverage is [scorff] She doesn't want to be beaten by you? Sword of Samothes? Defender of the Undying Fire?

ART: Do you want me to read my alignment move to you? That's what I’m- that's the checklist I'm going off of.

AUSTIN: Yeah totally! Give me the- give me the Parlay. [pause] There’s a 13. Uhm… she says, through tears

AUSTIN (as Maria): [wobbly]  I- I believe that we’re doing- we’re trying to help! I’m sorry. I’m sorry! Please don’t- [voice breaks] please don't. Please, let me go....

ART: Hadrian gets up and tells her to go.

ART (as Hadrian): don’t come back here.

AUSTIN: She nods, twice. 

AUSTIN (as Maria): [teary] It’s so dark. How do we- things used to be better. When I was little, I used to go to the church and… there was so much hope, it seemed like things were gonna get better. And then they got worse. I’m just trying... [voice breaks] I just want things to be better...How do we help people?

ART (as Hadrian): I don’t know anymore. [sigh] But its not this.

AUSTIN: She nods, and… removes like a- a badge from her armor, and tosses it to the ground. And then like, reaches down next to that, and picks up her blade and sheathes  it

AUSTIN (as Maria): I- I’m sorry. 

ART (as Hadrian): I’m sorry I scared you.

ALI: [soft awww sound]

AUSTIN (as Maria): Are you? 

ART: Are you asking me?

AUSTIN: She does.

ART: Oh, she asks, okay. I thought that was- I thought that was Austin for a second [laughing]

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN: [amused] No, no… But also, are you?

ART: Yeah!

AUSTIN: Okay.

ART: Of course I am!

ART (as Hadrian): I thought- I thought a lot of people were about to die. [pause] I had to- I had to stop you

AUSTIN (as Maria): [softly] I was so scared…

AUSTIN: And she swallows.

ART (as Hadrian): I was scared too.

AUSTIN (as Maria): Alright… I’m- Thank you. Thank you. If you ever- I'm from a little village outside Velas. If you ever need anything, let me know. I’m gonna go back now- [Art overlaps] see what I can do.

ART (as Hadrian): [overlapping] Thank you. Be at peace my child.

AUSTIN: She nods, and [pause] tries to figure out where the fuck to go. In the woods.

ART (as Hadrian): Moss grows on the north side of the tree.

AUSTIN (as Maria): [scoffs] O-okay! [mumbling] What does that mean?
[Dre, Janine & Ali laugh]

AUSTIN: [laughing] She says as she walks away!

ART: [amused] That's the one thing Hadrian remembers from school, I don't know.

AUSTIN: [laughing] Good. Uhm, so here's the thing that happens is, when the sun is supposed to rise, it doesn't. The- Uh…. Hieron moves out of the way of the moonlight? Of the moons, so it kinda loses sink? But it’s still night time. It’s just that the- the light is hitting the moons again, and is giving them- the reflection of the light of the moon is lighting things, a little bit? But the sun ain’t out.

ART: Cool.

[Ali chuckles]

ART: Uh…

AUSTIN: [sighs] Red Jack is awake, finally. Do y’all just like, stay out through the night, do you go back to- [amused] do you go back to bed, Adaire? Were you like “alright, fuck it”?

JANINE: Uhm…

AUSTIN: Also, Hella you've seen- you saw Adaire save someone's life! [laughs] Like a good doctor can!

[Janine laughs]

ALI: Nice.

JANINE: [laughing] Yeah, great.

AUSTIN: You have that medical history, huh Adaire?

JANINE: Yeah! That’s-

AUSTIN: Uh-huh!

JANINE: Yep. [soft laugh] We’ve mentioned that before!

AUSTIN: Uh-uh 

[Ali and Janine laugh]

AUSTIN: So yeah, are you up through the night, do you all just try to sleep more? Is it weird to wake up and then just like, it’s still night time?

JANINE: I have the option to like, broom more shit when I have time but that feels cheap, and also I feel like she wouldn’t like- you have to have time to like, gather supplies and stuff? [Austin overlaps] And I feel like she wouldn’t-

AUSTIN: [overlapping] Yeah, right.

JANINE: -Adaire is greedy but I don’t think she’s gonna- she’s gonna dip into Red Jack’s booze while he’s sleeping…

AUSTIN: [laughing] Fair…

JANINE: She probably just like lets it go, like “uh, it wasn’t that much stuff anyways, it’ll be fine”.

AUSTIN: Yeah.

JANINE: They'll fix it up later.

AUSTIN: Uh-huh.

ART: I’m probably just- just begging for bad outcomes right now

AUSTIN: [laughing] Uh-huh?

[Ali and Janine laugh]

ART: But when the sun doesn’t come up, could I try Guidance again?

AUSTIN: Sure.

ART: Or is it- is that-

AUSTIN: Oh, you could.

[Janine laughs]

AUSTIN: You didn't lose the spell, right? I didn't take the spell from you.

ART: Eh, you didn’t say it out loud. [laughs] It’s worth noting that I was trying to not roll that? But- cause we were talking? But that’s-

AUSTIN: You rolled it- You rolled a 7. On Guidance, so do you lose the spell, do you take another negative or do you- uh, do you take a negative or do you draw unwanted attention?

ART: Jeez, those are all pretty bad right now, huh.

AUSTIN: Yeah.

ART: I’ll take unwanted attention.

AUSTIN: There are wolves, howling in the distance.

ART: Okay…

AUSTIN: Red Jack wakes up. 

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): Uh, it’s about noon. I think we’re supposed to get to that galde now.

ART: Right, I'm- I'm sorry, I'm not sure you gave any guidance?

AUSTIN: The wolves were howling in the distance.

ART: Uh….

[Ali chuckles]

AUSTIN: You would instinctually pull the cloak a little closer. The cloak of Samot

ART: Oh, boy… Uh, nothing’s working right.

[Janine & Ali laugh]

ART: Alright…

ALI: What would the moths do after all of this, do they just kinda go back to their houses, or...?

AUSTIN: Well… [Ali laughs] It takes a while to like, put it together. But in the morning, some of them are dead and others should be, and aren’t. And the wounded that should be and aren’t, just rest near the Weaver King, and hope that water comes soon.

DRE: How’s- How’s my friend? How’s Frond?

AUSTIN: Frond’s good!

DRE: Okay.

JANINE: [relieved noises]

AUSTIN: [long sigh] Frond uh- comes over to you with ah… God, what sort of good gift does Frond give Throndir?

DRE: Hm…

AUSTIN: Also the shipping name for them is definitely Fr-[long beeping noise], right?

DRE: [amused] Yes. 

ART: I don’t think we’re supposed to tell people that? I think we’re supposed to let people come up with their own ship names…

AUSTIN: [amused] Alright, beep that out, Ali. Then they'll come up with their own ship names. Uhm… but it’s the obvious one.

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN: God, what’s the- Oh, it’s like uhm… Frond comes to you with like a rice cake? That has like maple syrup on it.

[Ali & Dre awww]

AUSTIN: And gives it to you, and like chitter-chatters at you and then like- basically says 
“Breakfast”. Uh- and then like stretches and like shakes off the- Or actually, probably not breakfast, it probably says like… like, uhm…

AUSTIN (as Frond): Snack, before bed!

AUSTIN: Ali in the chat says “This might be a “why do lightsabers stop” question but can they not get water from the snow?”  Uh, the snow doesn’t just- [Janine overlaps] 

JANINE: [overlapping] I was also thinking that...

1:00:00 MINUTE MARK

AUSTIN: -The snow doesn’t just melt? I- You could’ve asked Red Jack this at any point. The snow doesn't just melt, and you should not fuck with fire here.

DRE: [disappointed noise]

JANINE: I mean, there’s- uh…

AUSTIN: Don’t fuck with fire around this moths.

JANINE: I wasn't gonna suggest fire.

ALI: Like, [Austin overlaps] you could, far away...

AUSTIN: [overlapping] How are you gonna melt it?

JANINE: Body heat.

[Dre laughs]

AUSTIN: This doesn't- it’s too cold.

JANINE: [disappointed noise]

DRE: Just roll around the snow for a while [laughs]

AUSTIN: Yeah.

[laughter gets louder]

JANINE: [amused] Yeah, I don’t know, there are options. [pause] The volume i think is the problem with the…

AUSTIN: Like that is definitely uh… a thing that's like, he tried that once? And it did not- it didn’t work out. Like he- he definitely said the same thing you did. 

[Ali & Janine laugh]

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): Really? Well, just melt it! Give me some sticks! And- wooo, these sticks are people! Whoops!

[Laughter intensifies]

AUSTIN: Uhm…[laughs]

JANINE:It’s also a lot of labor, on that- y’know, a river does not… [Austin overlaps] must certainly have the same amount of labor…

AUSTIN: [overlapping] Right, exactly! Like- exactly, the ecosystem was literally- this Weaver King was just like- hung out near the river? And was able to get its roots all up in there? And then it was good! [amused] And by roots I mean its toes, its little toes.

ALI: Right...

AUSTIN: Uhm… [pause]

[Janine & Ali start talking at the same time, incomprehensible]

AUSTIN: Huh?

ALI: They have a bunch of hands and they also have bunch of feet?

AUSTIN: Yeah, yeah! They're weavers, they're like Hedy. They’re all just tangled up together.

ALI: [disgust noises] right…

AUSTIN: And none of their heads are on the outside, all of their heads are on the inside.

ALI: Right, so they can-

JANINE: What’s that thing called when a- when a bunch of rat tails get all [Dre overlaps] tangled up together?

DRE: [overlapping] It’s a rat king!

AUSTIN: It’s a rat king. This is literally just that.

JANINE: [laughing] So, okay-

AUSTIN: [amused] We set this up! We set this up during The Quiet Year!

JANINE: Right, right.

AUSTIN: Yeah, this is a Weaver King! Uhm…This is a- we call this a callback, in the biz’.

[Ali & Janine laugh]

DRE: [amused] Jeez...

ART: The museum biz’.

AUSTIN: The museum biz’? Thank you, thank you Art.

DRE: [laughing] The final Art biz’.

[laughter continues]

ALI: God [laughs]

AUSTIN: [long exhale] So do you go to that little glade?

JANINE: I- We gotta go to that little glade!

DRE: Uh-huh.

AUSTIN: uhm….god.

JANINE: See who Sol [starts laughing] wrestled up for us!

AUSTIN: Funny story. [pause] Sol’s there. Uh. By himself. He has like a folio under his- like a folder under his arms?

JANINE: I walk up with my hand held out. For my money back, because he fucked up.

AUSTIN: He says

AUSTIN (as Sol): Wo, wo wo wo wo! Wo? Wo, wo! You're looking at the new trade representative of Twinbrook! 

AUSTIN: [amused] And he gives you a napkin with-

ART: Shut up!

AUSTIN: He gives you the- the napkin with uh…[laughs] the Regent’s symbol on it?

JANINE: Adaire looks a little pissed off, but listens [laughs]

[Austin laughs]

ALI: Yeah… that's just rubbing our noses a bit….[laughs]

AUSTIN:Uh-huh

AUSTIN (as Sol): So for… [humming] a little off the top? I might be able to make a deal.

JANINE (as Adaire): Oh, sorry, how does a trade representative have anything to do with the like, works and infrastructure of the town?

AUSTIN (as Sol): Well, the thing is they need the water right? So I figured I would start a water delivery service here.

JANINE: uhm…

AUSTIN: He like, taps his head. But only twice, he’s not the guy from the from the bar -[laughs]

JANINE: [laughing] Yeah…

AUSTIN: -he doesn't do it 3 times.

AUSTIN (as Sol): what do they need, a couple buckets a day?

DRE (as Throndir): That’s not-

AUSTIN (as Sol): No big deal!

DRE (as Throndir): That's not gonna work, Sol.

JANINE (as Adaire): No… they need a lot more than- They need a river. They need a river’s worth of water [laughs, Austin overlaps] and that's gonna be very taxing on the horses. 

AUSTIN (as Sol): [overlapping] But I know what you just- Noooo, why don't we just melt the snow.

[Ali laughs]

DRE (as Throndir): [amused] They thought of that. [Ali overlaps] It didn't work

ALI (as Hella): [overlapping, amused] That's a good idea.

AUSTIN (as Sol): Hella, I knew I could trust you.

ALI (as Hella): Yeah, right!

[Janine chuckles]

AUSTIN (as Sol): [deep breath] they really don’t wanna. They reeeeally don't wanna- uh…drop the dam. Because people-

JANINE (as Adaire): They don't have to drop it completely!

AUSTIN (as Sol): It’s not a dam, then! Adaire!

JANINE (as Adaire): No! [laughs]

AUSTIN (as Sol): That's a- You gotta dam it up otherwise the people go through.

ALI: Uh-huh

DRE (as Throndir): Why can’t they just build like, grills [Janine overlaps] and gates and stuff?

JANINE (as Adaire): [overlapping] I mean- Yes! That is exactly [laughs] where I'm tryna get at!

AUSTIN (as Sol): Well that seems-

JANINE (as Adaire): They could build... a gate? And, benefit of it, you get a gate with- with this sort of, relatively fine, sort of bar structure? And then you let the young fish through, so they can still breed and stuff, unimpeded, but the big fish get caught and then you get to scoop ‘em up and eat them and stuff- [Austin overlaps]

AUSTIN: Give me a fucking inteligence roll! 

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN: [amused] ‘cause I don't believe that Adaire knows this much about fishing!

ART: [Janine overlaps] Wait, why’d they build a dam in-

JANINE: She’s- Okay- [overlapping] One, She's been in a lot of places, two, she's from a coastal city.

AUSTIN: [doubtful] Hm...

DRE: Hold on, can I aid and assist her?

AUSTIN: [amused] uh- sure.

DRE: ‘Cause I know a lot about fishes

JANINE: Also this seems like a Spout Lore. Right?

AUSTIN: This is Spout Lore- This is Spout Lore

ART: why ‘d they build a dam instead of putting up a net?

ALI: Yeah, can I argue against this? [laughs]

AUSTIN: sure! Totally!

JANINE: I feel like the net might’ve gone like, shredded by the ice?

AUSTIN: Yeah…That’s fair.

JANINE: [Janine overlaps] But still like, great so-

ALI: Wait- [overlapping] you put bars there and people still fall and get stuck in the bars with the fish! Like- [laughs] People are still gonna die!

JANINE: I mean, people still got stuck on the wall. But they're still under the thing, the point is just to keep them from drifting down, and a grate will do the same thing.

ALI: [scoffs] I don’t even know why I say anything [laughs]

JANINE. [laughs] to my spell lore roll?

ALI: [quietly] I guess…

AUSTIN: Or- let Throndir do his aid/assist.

DRE: Oh, right. Is that just 2d6 +bond?

AUSTIN: +1, yeah. [pause] that's a 7! So that means if she fails, you get caught up in whatever the outcome is.

JANINE: Uh… big money…

[Ali laughs]

DRE: No way I missed.

AUSTIN: That's an 8, which means, again, that it’s like- useful not- alright, interesting, not useful. Uhm, you totally know that you could build some sort of dam system? You just don't know how to do that. You're like “u,h you could do it in a way that let's the water go through!” but you don't understand the actual mechanics of it in a way that could- that you could explain it to a person. [optimistic] Uhm- but you could use that still as bargaining. As like, an idea.

JANINE: Yeah…

AUSTIN: So you-

JANINE: I mean they have a person who figured out how to use a head to make a dam, so, that person [Austin overlaps] might be also-

AUSTIN: [overlapping] I mean, the dam is- the dam is “we put a bunch of stuff there, to stop the water from going”

[Janine laughs]

 AUSTIN: Like- it isn’t a great dam, that dude probably would’ve eventually broken it, with enough time, and something better than just a sword. Uhm… he says

AUSTIN (as sol): alright, how ‘bout this then: you wanna fix this, then make the moths build it. They come up, and they go down there, and they work on it until it’s a thing that lets the water through or whatever but- we’re not putting uhh… our lives on that. that sounds dangerous. [pause] As a trade representative! Of Twinbrook! 

AUSTIN: [amused] he says and puffs out his chest a little bit.

AUSTIN (as Sol): I have to think of my constituents!

JANINE (as Adaire): Is this an elected position?

AUSTIN (as Sol): it was assigned. Appointed! Appointed, actually, that's a better word.

DRE: Is uh… is Red Jack with us for this?

AUSTIN: Yeah, but he’s still like a little- he’s still not all there [Art overlaps] He’s sitting on the-

ART: [overlapping, incomprehensible]

AUSTIN: Huh?

ART: I would’ve healed him if I knew he was coming with us

AUSTIN: Oh yeah, he’s definitely there with you- He’s healed! He’s fine, he’s stable. but like, he still ain’t... kicking.

JANINE: He’s had a rough night [chuckles]

AUSTIN: Yeah!

[pause]

ART: I’ve never used this ability in this way

AUSTIN: Gooood opening.

[Dre laughs]

AUSTIN: [amused] I love this game.

ART: Can I “I am the Law” this?

AUSTIN: [interested] hm. Yeah- [Art overlaps] “when you give an NPC an order”.

ART: [overlapping] Can I give them an order?

AUSTIN: Yeah. Totally. 

ART (as Hadrian): So… y’know, Sol. I wanna tell you what Samothes wants. And more importantly?

ART: And I kinda like, puff up my chest a little bit?

ART (as Hadrian): [threatening] What I want.

ALI: Ooh...

AUSTIN (as Sol): [quietly] Uh, okay.

ART (as Hadrian): I want you to treat these people well, to deal with them fairly, and to do whatever you can to make the situation actually work, and actually help them. Do you hear me? 

AUSTIN: Gimme a roll.

ART: I roll, charisma. And I-

AUSTIN: You did it!

ART: I did Okay.

AUSTIN: You did Okay [laughs]

ART: So he can either do what I say, flee, which I guess [laughs] is always an option.

[Dre & Janine laugh]

ART: Or, he could attack me. 

AUSTIN: He says, uh…

AUSTIN (as Sol): Alright. [pause] Uh-huh? I see how it is. You church-types. Hey Adaire! Here’s your money back. 

AUSTIN: And he tosses you his coins.

AUSTIN (as Sol): you told me there’d be money here to make. [mocking] This guy’s talking about morals. Who needs ‘em.

JANINE (as Adaire): People who wanna make money.

AUSTIN (as Sol): [scoffs] Can’t feed people with morals. Feed people with fish. 

AUSTIN: And he flees.

ART (as Hadrian): MyOur dad was a fisherman. 

AUSTIN (as Sol): [sarcastic] Yeah that's nice.

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN (as Sol): [sarcastic] I’m sure he’s really proud of you. We’ll be back. Tavira and her uh- What are they called? The Anchor? They’re almost here. They don't take kindly to folks like you, and there’s a lot of ‘em. And the bridge will open, and it’ll be connected to Rosemerrow again and I can be on my way. You don't need to bring me back my cart, we’ll come get it.

ALI (as Hella): since when are you so close to them? [laughs]

AUSTIN (as Sol): I know how to make a buck. I see someone come home, tell me a story about the- [scoffs] a town of sin, that's an opportunity. Where there's sin, there’s money.

ART: Sol is grosser than he let on!

[Ali laughs]

ALI: The moth idea was a good one, by the way. I just wanna put that out there.

AUSTIN: [laughs] The one where you make the moths build their super dangerous thing they don't know how to build?

ALI: Yeah! They're the ones who want it so badly!

AUSTIN (as Sol): I knew this girl had a good head on her shoulders. You come with me, we could make a couple dollars!

ALI: Ugh…

AUSTIN (as Sol): You could oversee it.

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN (as Sol): we’ll keep ‘em in shape.

ALI (as Hella): Ugh… No, I’ve-

AUSTIN: I’ve changed my mind completely, this guy’s bad [laughs]

[Ali laughs]

JANINE: Yeah I was gonna say, has Sol turned his back to me yet?

AUSTIN: Oh yeah hes gonna- he’s like- he’s taken out a pocket watch, and is twirling it? As he walks away? Also he-

JANINE: I would like to- can I backstab- I want to backstab him [Austin overlaps] with my rapier.

AUSTIN: [overlapping] Jesus Christ! [laughs]

ALI: [surprised] Woah!

AUSTIN: [amused] I Mean! You can

JANINE: Give me a reason why I wouldn’t!

AUSTIN: [yelling] ‘cause he’s a HUMAN BEING!

[everyone laughs]

JANINE: [laughing] He’s a jerk!

ALI: [laughing] He is kind of a dick, but like, that's it! That's all that he is!

ART: Sometimes people are dicks, that's just what the world is!

JANINE: Can I take out my rapier and like- is he like wearing suspenders or something?

AUSTIN: No…-yeah, sure. You know-

[Dre, Austin & Ali talking over each other]

AUSTIN: Maybe you should’ve been evil! We had that whole talk about how you weren’t evil and now you're like “I wanna kill this man for being a jerk”! 

JANINE: I’m just saying- look, we entered into a fucking arrangement and the first chance he sees to get something that, honestly, isn’t even that much better than just playing along to what I offered? He goes off fucking… Fancy-pants watch twirler.

[Ali & Austin laugh]

AUSTIN (as Sol): [mocking] That's me!

JANINE: And honestly, that's not how- that's not how my associates behave… [pause] That is-

AUSTIN: [amused] Uh-huh!

JANINE: I…[laughing] I wanna fuck with this dude.

ART: No, I'm thrilled about this, I'm not gonna be the most hated member of this group on Twitter anymore? You-

[loud laughter]

ART: You fuck up Sol if you feel like you need to.

AUSTIN: [sigh] Oh…

JANINE: Uh… so wait, give me- give me the like view of like what he’s doing. He’s twirling his watch-

AUSTIN: He’s leaving! And he's walking away!

JANINE: He’s leaving…

AUSTIN: He’s leaving the glade.

JANINE: Uh- does he have like a coin purse, hanging from his belt or anything?

AUSTIN: He is like you, he isn't a thief, but like- he is like you. He know what's what, he doesn't keep his wallet in his back pocket

JANINE: [quietly] That's fair…

AUSTIN: God

JANINE: Hm…

AUSTIN: [sigh] This one ti- hm.

[Ali chuckles]

AUSTIN: This one time [long beep] was in the mall? And just like, opened his wallet to show that he’d gotten paid in cash for some shit? And just had like 300 dollars in there? And like what are you doing?? Don’t do that!

[Art chuckles]

AUSTIN: Anyway. Welcome to Friends at the Table. Maybe you should beep out that name.

[Ali laughs]

JANINE: Uh… man.

AUSTIN: Yeah, the world is full of shitty people. [pause] Uhm- I- Like, unless you fuck with this dude like, he’s just gonna go, and that’s fine. Like, I don’t-

JANINE: I knooow, I’m tryna think of a good- like a gooood, smart way to fuck with him, but I’m not-

AUSTIN: [amused] The jerk store is all out of him or whatever. Like, that's the-

JANINE: That’s terrible. [laughs]

[Dre laughs]

ALI: Put a Kick Me sign on his back [chuckles]

AUSTIN: Nice. Nice. Chain that, jerk. [pause] I think the moment passes

JANINE: Wait- the… nono, I'm thinking long-game now i'm not thinking in the moment.

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN: Okay. And you have plenty of time! He walks away

JANINE: Yeah…

AUSTIN: You're in the glade. [sighs] Red Jack reaches back for his… Oh [laughs] Red Jack finishes a bottle of the whiskey from his- from his cart? And tosses it so it smashes right to the left of Sols like, head? Like on a tree? And Sol like- he flinches but he doesn't look back. And then Red Jack bellows out a laugh. Uhm… [more serious tone] And he isn't lying. The Anchor- the metal pala-din the ordennans have- at this point they've arrived to Twinbrook. And there are a lot of them

AUSTIN:. I think next episode- when I first planned this whole scenario out I had Seven Samurai in my head? Uhm- the pitch was going to be- basically be that Red Jack was like, the Bandit King? Who was coming to attack the village of this [Janine laughs]- this shitty village that doesn't understand like, right form wrong and kinda just wants their fucking money? And wants the bandits to back the fuck off- and the bandits aren't good or anything  but like, that was gonna be the basic gist of it? Uhm [pause] I didn't fully expect you to go to his town and like, for the reverse Seven Samurai to happen? But here we are!

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN: Here we are… [long sigh] Are there things that you wanna do before the end of the day? Again, it’s still nighttime out. 

ART: [Austin overlaps] Yeah! How weird is it?

AUSTIN: [overlapping] Sol doesn't really talk about that at all. I think-

JANINE: Uh...

AUSTIN: -Yeah. Yeah.

JANINE: I wanna ask… Adaire asks Red Jack about the holes in the ground in town.

AUSTIN: Uh, he laughs and says

AUSTIN (as Red Jack): Oh… one of those plans that didn't work out, uh… exactly as I intended. You see, Frond was supposed to grab everyone’s attention, and while that was happening… uh, the weavers and I were going to seal the cart. We were gonna lead it into the woods, and once it was in the woods I would get it with Ace, and we would lead it down to town. Uh… but they moved a little slowly and- you would’ve heard with Frond, so. [sigh] Got to make things up as you go along sometimes.

JANINE (as Adaire): [bitter] ugh, you telling me….

AUSTIN: In the middle of- of the day, Hella, Rosette just does the thing she did before? When she stole- when she tried to steal away Adaire? And just like, lands next to you?

ALI: [laughs knowingly]

AUSTIN: And she- again, ‘cause she's like the only moth here that can speak in like, a vaguely human tongue. Uhm- again, kinda stitched together language from what she's heard, says

AUSTIN (as Rosette): Why don't you like us? 

ALI: [laughs sadly] Oh…

AUSTIN (as Rosette): You are strong. I respect strong. Hm… and you don't trust. You don't sense wrong, you only sense strong.

AUSTIN: She isn't like- it isn't broken English, she just literally doesn't have a recording of someone say strength- saying strength. 

ALI: Right… Uhm…

ALI (as Hella): Honestly, I just don't wanna get involved.

AUSTIN (as Rosette): If you don’t, then... why- [struggling with words]

AUSTIN: She's trying to find the words.

AUSTIN (as Rosette): It’s- [pause] There is no outside.

AUSTIN: She says.

AUSTIN (as Rosette): We’re all inside.

ALI: [sigh] I think Hella kinda squints and is like-

ALI (as Hella): W-What?

AUSTIN (as Rosette): I am not q-queen. I am just god at job.

ALI (as Hella): [sigh] what does that have to do with me?

AUSTIN: [grunts] She shakes her head. [amused] And then she- she does like a sigh that's like seven different sighs at once?

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN: Like- [Tries to do seven different sighs at once]. It like- it sounds like someone slowly strumming a- like a stringed instrument? Like goes ‘Brrrr’ like it’s- [laughs] It completely detunes.

ALI: Aw, I miss them...

AUSTIN: [laughs] Yeah

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN: Fair. uhm… she says

AUSTIN (as Rosette): You have sword, but no soldiers. Why?

ALI (as Hella): I fight for myself.

AUSTIN (as Rosette): No self.

ALI: Uh…

AUSTIN: She- she like, nods her head over to the Weaver King

ALI (as Hella): Wh-? [Sigh] I don't underst- Do you want me to like stop them? What do you- [laughs]

AUSTIN (as Rosette): Is a waste. You are a waste.

[Ali laughs]

ALI (as Hella): I’m not! Ugh- if they're right about you I’m not- I’m not helping.

AUSTIN: She… points to your sword. And then like gestures to draw it. And then like raises her hand to be like “No no no, it’s okay” but just draw it. She says “hold it out”

ALI: Hm…

AUSTIN (as Rosette): Hold it out!

ALI: Uhm- I guess I do so like, cautiously?

AUSTIN: She's- she like, makes a sound with her wings over to your left? So that it catches your attention? And then with her foot she lifts up and like, ax-kicks it out of your hand.

ALI: What?? No.

AUSTIN: And then says

AUSTIN (as Rosette): Pick it up.

ALI: What- [laughing] -getting owned by this moth lady??

[Dre laughs]

AUSTIN: [smug] She's very good.

ALI: [sigh] You should need to have to roll stuff sometimes, ‘cause that's-

AUSTIN: Anytime you pause I can make a move 

ALI: [laughing] Okay… I-[Austin overlaps]

AUSTIN: Think of the thing she said.

ALI: God…

AUSTIN (as Rosette): Two hands.

ALI: [yelling] What-?? [sigh]

AUSTIN (as Rosette): Or don't 

AUSTIN: She says and like, chuckles.

ALI: [laughing] Is there a way to like- Hmmmmm! Austin! Is there a way to like-

AUSTIN: You don’t have to

ALI: -take it up without my back to her?

AUSTIN: Sure

ALI: Okay…

ART: It’s- It’s walking around

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN: [amused] Yeah, just step so that you keep looking at her and pick it up.

ALI: [laughing] Yeah…

JANINE: She's not gonna kick your butt! Like, you actual butt! [laughing] You fall over in the snow and laugh at you- like-

[Dre & Ali laugh]

AUSTIN: She like- she's over- two antenna come down and point at her eyes? As to say like “look me in the eye”

ALI: Lord ugh… yeah…

AUSTIN: Are you gripping the blade with both hands?

ALI: Yes. [laughs]

AUSTIN: And she tries it again, with like all of her might? And it doesn't move. You're able to hold it steady. And in fact like, it cuts her foot. [hisses] And she like puts it down on the snow and pats it, so the snow gets in there. And she says

AUSTIN (as Rosette): Two hands. And then looks at your- like, looks at the rest of the crew and Throndir is playing with Kodiak, and I don't know what Adaire and Hadrian are doing. But I- the only one I know for sure what's happening [starts laughing] is Throndir is playing with Kodiak! But I think we just get like- what are you guys going? What are Hadrian and Adaire doing, at that moment?

JANINE: Adaire’s fucking stewing. 

AUSTIN: Okay. Good.

JANINE: She's just not like having fucking- she does not like people fucking- going back on their word.

AUSTIN: Fair

JANINE:  Or offering her suboptimal plans when things were all fucking sorted out

AUSTIN: Uh-huh. I like- I like-

JANINE: -does not care for-

AUSTIN: Yeah, Adaire’s just like, pacing. And Hadrian, what about you?

JANINE: Dark looks

ART: Hadrian is praying for the sun.

AUSTIN: Okay. Uh, she gestures to both of them. To both of you and to Throndir, and she says again, Hella, 

AUSTIN (as Rosette): Two hands. You're only one.

AUSTIN: Uh, and then flutters away. To go check on the wounded. The wounded but not yet dead- or undead. Like, I think as the day goes on, it hits you both, Hadrian and Hella, as the people here who have like, proper military experience? That you need to get people into shape before the pala-din come- the Anchor show up. Or you go- it’s not your duty necessarily? But I'm curious how the two of you talk about what's about to happen.

[silence]

AUSTIN: [scoff]

[Ali laughs]

AUSTIN: Or do you not even- can you not even breach it.

ALI: [laughing] I…

ART: No no, I'm- I'm- I can… I can talk about this, believe me.

[Ali & Austin laugh]

ALI: [amused] It has not occurred Hella that she has anything to do. It’s just- I’ll put- [starts laughing]

ART (as Hadrian): Have you- have you fought any of these before?

ALI (as Hella): Uhm- What? No. Of course not.

ART (as Hadrian): I don’t know, maybe it’s part of- it’s part of training…

ALI (as Hella): I mean, I've seen them fight. They're- it’s weird, it doesn't feel good, but-

ART (as Hadrian): We ran into some pala-din in the south. This was his cloak.

ALI (as Hella): Oh. [pause] Yeah? [laughs]

ART (as Hadrian): Well. Kind of. [pause] In a spiritual sense.

ALI (as Hella): Like I said Hadrian, they're doing good work

ART (as Hadrian): They're gonna- they're gonna hurt these people.

 [SONG “Inside” STARTS PLAYING]

ALI (as Hella): [sigh] If they're cursed… Uh, I don't wanna see Nacre in here at all.

ART (as Hadrian): Are you doing this?

ALI (as Hella): Doing what?

ART (as Hadrian): The curse. Did that come back... with you? And Fero, ad Lem.

ALI (as Hella): Me and Fero and Lem have never been to this town before. How would you even- Hadrian.

ART (as Hadrian): I'm sorry.

ALI (as Hella): Are you- ugh.

ART (as Hadrian): I didn't know.

ALI (as Hella): When I killed her I thought that it would be the end of it. And its still here. If they're gonna stop it i'm not gonna stand in their way.

ART (as Hadrian): I’ve killed a lot of people, thinking it would answer questions. It hasn’t done it yet.

[“Inside” CONTINUES TILL THE END]
