Winter in Hieron 14: What Do You Want Here?
Transcribed by Sarah @confusedbluesky

ALI: Last time, on Friends at the Table.

JACK: Chancellor Lutz was killed—was turned into a big pile of ash, in his top floor room. Shortly afterwards, a gknoll—a very large gknoll, that looked but didn’t necessarily behave like Mother Glory, was seen running through the canyon, which is kind of like a bazaar. At the same time, Arrel, who is actually Phantasmo—[Ali kind of laughs] We’ve broken into his kind of like, place. And found that he is trying to put—or to steal people away to this kind of like, eternity prison. As an attempt to save them from the Heat and the Dark?

AUSTIN (as Blake Bromly): There is this weird group. Uh, the Cult of the Dark Sun, I should’ve just never messed with them. But um—

JANINE (as Adaire): Cults can be like that.

[MUSIC - “Outside” starts]

AUSTIN (as Blake): Yeah they have “cult” right in the title, right?

JANINE (as Adaire): Yeah.

AUSTIN (as Blake): They think something really bad is coming. And, they kind of just [kind of snorts] want to get it over with. 

SYLVIA (as Ephrim): You said that this cult, this Dark Sun group, is a sect, or some offshoot, of the Creed of Samothes. Do you have anything on anyone who is involved?

AUSTIN (as Gloria Lake): We think that the lay minister here, Obelday Adelbury, might have some connection. 

JACK: I’m gonna make it clear that if they don’t give me the hilt right now, one of them is going to kill another one of them.

AUSTIN: No one asks you to stop. And he kills this other guy with a big metal stick.

AUSTIN (as Sid Half-Off): Alright, look. [Jack “hmm”s] Over and over again he’s working with this guy, A. Hyphen A, hyphen A, hyphen A. He sells him this, he sells him that, apparently this guy really likes his perry, I don’t know. It goes down, but then in this one, this last one, it says just—it says—it’s the other way around. Instead of having the goods in the goods column it just says like, “personal effects” in the payment column, and then in the goods column it says, a transportation fee.

[music ends]

AUSTIN: [sighs] There in the distance, finally, you can see the first hint of a moon, turning to the sky. As turn five begins. Where are you going? Let’s—

JANINE (overlapping with Austin): You know where I’m going.

ALI: Mhmm.

AUSTIN: I do know where you’re going.

KEITH: I’m going to—

JANINE (overlapping with Keith): TM3.

KEITH: Viridian Village.

[Ali sighs]

AUSTIN: [to himself] TM3. [louder] Where in Viridian—oh, so you’re going to—to… 

KEITH: Village Center and Prison, B3.

AUSTIN: Where is everybody else going? I guess Ephrim and… Let’s start with Ephrim and Hadrian?

SYLVIA (overlapping with Austin): Yeah. Going to the church.

ART (overlapping with Sylvia): Yep.

AUSTIN: Hadrian also going to the church?

ART: Yep. We’ll see how this goes.

[Ali snorts]

AUSTIN: Um—

KEITH: Someone should go see Slayton. She might have more info on the Dark—the cult.

ALI (doubtful): Yeah?

AUSTIN: He really believes this.

KEITH (defensive): Everyone’s laughing. Uh, she—hey—

JACK (overlapping): Ah, god.

ALI (overlapping): I mostly just want to—

KEITH (overlapping): She hung out there. You said—

JACK: Yeah.

KEITH: —we couldn’t get any info with Jack, cause he told everyone his name and then tried to assassinate one of them.

AUSTIN: That’s not what happened. 

JACK (overlapping with Austin): No, well, that’s not how it g—how it went. 

ALI: If I’m going with Slaton I just want to like go there and just be like, “Just let her out. What are you doing?” [laughs]

AUSTIN: Mhm.

ALI: What are you doing?

JACK (overlapping with Ali): I have the—

KEITH (overlapping with Jack): If ever—everyone seems convinced that that’s not the case. It’s not weird that that would be the case. If you were having an affair with someone, you might know something about the cult that they’re in.

[Ali laughs]

JACK: Wow.

KEITH: Cultists tend to stick to their own.

JACK: I’m trying to think if… Can I do anything useful with this ridiculous hell’s hilt that I got through villainy.

AUSTIN: I don’t know that that was villainy, but maybe it was. Um—

ALI: Mmm!

JACK: Look all I’m saying is I’m neutral, I’m neutral.

AUSTIN: Uh, I know a place that would know what to do with it—or I know where—ah—look at the list and you tell me where would you would go and be like, “Hey I have this weird thing what is this weird thing?”

JACK: Uhh…

JANINE: I don’t know that Elgash is gonna be much help here. [sort of laughs]

AUSTIN: Yeah but that’s still—that’s still an Archives place. 

JACK: Yeah, it would be—it would be going to the Archives. Yeah. Can I get to the Archives? Where are they? They are…

AUSTIN: Yeah, you’re in—oh wait, where are you now?

JACK: Oh, I’m in…

ALI (overlapping with Jack): He’s still in…

AUSTIN (overlapping with Jack and Ali): Right, you’re not in Roseheart.

JACK: No.

ALI (overlapping with Jack): Yeah.

AUSTIN: Where are you?

JACK: I’m in Westshore.

AUSTIN: Yeah, you can’t, it would take you two turns.

JACK: Jesus. Can I quickly hand it to—can I throw it—it’s very heavy.

[Janine laughs softly]

KEITH: Um—

AUSTIN: You can messenger service it to somebody else.

KEITH: You could—would he be able to find something in the—in the… museum?

JACK (overlapping with Keith): Ahh, shit! [very faintly] It’s useless.

ALI: Where’s the Archives?

JACK: Shame I couldn’t go to the Archives. Ummm…

AUSTIN: I mean, you still have two—you still could. It would just take—

ALI: Wait, where is it though?

DRE: Uh, the Kickshaw? KS1?

AUSTIN: It’s in the Kickshaw.

ALI: Ohh.

AUSTIN: It would just mean you would have to start moving there this turn. Right?

ALI: Do you wanna give it to me? That would be weird if I went there alone, but I could… Maybe be able to handle it.

DRE (overlapping with Ali): I’ll go. I’ll go to the Archives. I mean I would like to see if this dude has been taken or not. 

JACK: Yeah I’m trying to think of what else I would do… [sighs] Well—ah, shit, hang on, wait a second.

AUSTIN: So you’re in Westshore, right?

JACK: Yeah… Well because the other thing that I kind of was thinking about doing was maybe seeing if I could swing by Marisol Sweetwater. 

AUSTIN: Right. She’s in Kickshaw.

JACK: Shit. [pause] Austin I feel realistically I should move because otherwise on the next turn I’m just going to be stuck in…

AUSTIN: Westshore. Yeah.

JACK (overlapping with Austin some): Yeah. So I should probably move and take the hit.

 AUSTIN: Okay.

JACK (overlapping with Austin): Yeah. 

AUSTIN: Where are you moving to?

JACK: I’m gonna try and go see Elgash.

AUSTIN: Okay. So you’re gonna be moving this turn.

JACK: Yeah.

AUSTIN: And there’s nowhere else—do you wanna double-dip in Roseheart for a quick question?

JACK: Yeah, I’ll st—[laughs] Sure, I’ll stop off in Roseheart, at… Oh, geez, um…

ALI (amused): Do you wanna go see [kind of snorts] Emmanuel again?

AUSTIN: Oh, that is totally viable.

ALI (overlapping with Austin, laughing): We lost him. Like—[laughs] We left.

AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah. You did.

JACK: Yeah. I’ll go see—I’ll go see Emmanuel.

ALI (overlapping): Yes.

AUSTIN (overlapping): That’s nice. Yeah. Yes. Good.

JANINE: It’s better than just burning the turn.

JACK: Yeah.

ALI: I think that he maybe like, stayed to help fix—fix that up.

AUSTIN (overlapping with Ali): Yes. That is exactly what happened.

ALI (overlapping): Yeah.

AUSTIN: What actually happened was we finished that recording and then [Ali “mhmm”s] in my head he was gonna keep traveling with you for a turn and then that just didn’t happen.

ALI: Uh-huh.

JANINE: Aww.

AUSTIN: But yeah, he’s—

JACK (overlapping): Well I can make up for it now.

AUSTIN: Yes. Exactly. Um… Written down that you’re going to Emmanuel. And Hella and Adaire are going to TN3. Throndir, where are you going?

DRE: Umm… Hmmm… Well—I mean I guess the one, like, kind of… Thing that we haven’t really… Figured out, is… I mean, do we think the fire manster—the fire monster isn’t one of the stars, is it?

AUSTIN (amused, overlapping): Firemancer.

[Janine laughs softly]

DRE: The firemancer, yeah.

 SYLVIA (overlapping with Dre): That’s me. 

DRE: Yes. That is you.

[Janine sort of laughs]

AUSTIN: The firemancer, Ephrim. Wait, what—

DRE: Cause—

AUSTIN: Yes—

DRE (overlapping): The fire—

AUSTIN: The description of the Bright One is very much in line with the description of what you saw from one of those weird sort of, from that star.

DRE: Okay. So it probably is the same thing. We gotta figure out where it came from, but it’s—we know what it is. Okay.

ALI (overlapping with Dre): Oh yeah. 

AUSTIN: Uh-huh. And you know that it—

DRE (overlapping): Okay.

AUSTIN: Yes. And you know that that had been around since like, the last week or so.

ALI: Right, it was there like, [stretching out the word] earlier? Which is weird?

AUSTIN: It was there—it’s been there since... the end of the last game.

 JACK: Those things are… The most frightening things.

[Ali laughs faintly]

AUSTIN: You saw one that landed.

JACK: Yeah, true.

DRE: Hmm.

 ALI: Yeah, I—at the start of this game Hella really wanted to find that thing and kill it, which she sort of did?

AUSTIN (overlapping): ‘Kay.

ALI: But not that one.

AUSTIN: Not that one. 

ALI (overlapping): But in her mind—

AUSTIN: That’s like saying—that’s like saying—“I really—that guy, that motherfucker’s hiding out in Boston, [Ali laughs] I’m gonna go kill him.” And then you just like, “That guy’s from Boston [Ali laughs] I’ll kill him.”

[everyone laughs]

AUSTIN (overlapping with laughter, barely audible): That’s you. Ohhh.

ALI (overlapping with laughter quieting): Hella Varal, everyone. Let’s go get some ice cream.

AUSTIN: Yeah—and then she gets ice cream!

[Art laughs]

AUSTIN: Uuuugh. God. Fuck.

[Dre laughs softly]

AUSTIN: Where are you going, Dre?

DRE: Oh, god. Um. [sort of muffled] Ttuh, tuh, tuhhhhh…

JANINE: The thing is like—again, I think the way the turns are gonna work out here is like, the only… Things that are guaranteed is like we have this turn and then the next turn and like, do you want to spend your next turn going to Roseheart?

DRE: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Yes. Yes. 

DRE (overlapping): Right.

AUSTIN (overlapping): It should be a place—

JANINE: So going somewhere where you wanna spend turn five and six, which is why I want to go to the mills, because we still haven’t been to the Current, and we still haven’t talked to Sol.

AUSTIN: Here’s how I’ll codify that, in fiction. Viridian Village has announced that it’s going to execute Mother Glory at, what is turn six, the end of turn six.

JACK: Oof. 

AUSTIN: Which is the like the most cynical bullshit? Because, now it d—it leaves the door open for somebody else to do it but the play that they’re making is, this will get them attention and people will like, come to Viridian Village, to see it.
JACK: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Um—instead of it just being a surprise thing. [Jack kind of groans] The mayor of Viridian Village is no Lenny Lenova, but is still a politician, and is still like—is still a politician that’s managed to claw their way up to be in charge of one of Rosemerrow’s districts which means they’re canny in the worst way.

JACK: Yeah.

DRE: Maybe I’ll go with Fero then….

AUSTIN: Mmm.

JACK: Being able to put some more weight behind that, I think.

ALI (overlapping with Jack): Yeah.

DRE: Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I’ll do that, I’ll go with Fero.

ALI (overlapping with Dre some): Also that sounds like Throndir’s thing.

DRE: It’s a very Throndir thing, yeah.
ALI (overlapping): Yeah.

JANINE: Mhmm.

ALI: Go free someone from some bonds.

[someone giggles very faintly]

JANINE: She has an alibi. Sort of. Mostly.

DRE: Yeah, but they may not care.
JANINE: Well, yeah.

ALI: You’re adding—Throndir to the wrong—he’s going with Fero.

[someone says something very faintly in agreement] 

AUSTIN (laughing): He’s gonna blow up Lem’s spot.

[Dre laughs]

ALI: Could you—

[laughter continues]

AUSTIN: Could you imagine?

ALI (overlapping): That sounds like—a bit like Throndir. [laughs]

AUSTIN: Lem is like, “I am gonna go see Emmanuel,” and Throndir’s like “Me too!”

[Janine gives a sort of pained laugh]

JACK: Oh, god.

AUSTIN (overlapping): Ugh. God.

[Keith laughs in background, overlapping]

SYLVIA (overlapping): “I wanna get more crepes for my dog!”

DRE: I need my dog’s badge back! I gave that to you.

JACK (overlapping with Dre): Let’s all go.

AUSTIN: [laughs] Oh, boy. 

[Dre laughs]

AUSTIN (overlapping with laughter): What are we—what are we doing? 

SYLVIA: I think we’re doing the church first?

AUSTIN: We’re doing the church first. Give me a roll.

SYLVIA: Art, do you want to roll? My roll20’s being a little weird.

AUSTIN: This roll will—

ART (overlapping): Sure. 

AUSTIN: Will truly determine a lot.

ART: You don’t fuckin put this pressure on other people, I’m just saying. 

AUSTIN: 2d6 plus 2. Uh-huh.

[Dre laughs]

AUSTIN: That’s an eight. At least you didn’t fail. So… Hadrian, is this the first time you’ve been to the church in Rosemerrow? 

ART (overlapping): Uh, probably.

AUSTIN: Cause you just kind of rushed here, right? Yeah.

ART: Yeah we kind of just got here, right?

AUSTIN: Alright so this is like a fucking megachurch. The one in Viridian Village is like, it’s the biggest building in Viridian Village by far and like, it completely, like, uhh… is like a different scale of building than like, even the center—this like, village center. It like… towers over the entire village. It’s not as tall as like, the Wistful Peaks, like skyscrapers are? But like, this is the church that everybody from Roseheart, Wistful Peaks, the Mills, Flankfields, Viridian Village comes to. There’s another like smaller church in Creek Crescent that people—other people might go to, there’s probably a couple of other little churches. But like, this is the one. Um, and it is—like I said, a megachurch. Like there are probably… Five to ten thousand people in this thing? Like it's—

ART (overlapping some): Just like, right now in the middle of the d—oh you said it was mass, never mind.

AUSTIN (overlapping some): It’s mass right, yeah, so you show up for mass. Everything is inside is like white and tall and… You know if you were a halfling imagine it would be even taller [snorts] right?

ART: Sure.

AUSTIN: And it has this like weird system of lenses and mirrors that let you have—and then like, that magnify the image of the deacon, Obelday Adelbury, as he’s finishing his sermon onstage. Um, and then there is also a… There is also a… System of like, amplification, like it’s not built to be for voices to amplify obviously, but there are also just like, amplification horns set up around the place. Halflings I guess have figured out how to make speakers, just without a microphone. Um. Not like—it’s not—the thing is like I wish it could just be an amphitheater, just look like that, but it doesn’t, it just looks like a megachurch. And this guy is like walking around the—this guy is walking around the stage, and is like, projecting his voice, he’s a halfling, uh, preacher. I guess Ephrim you probably have met this dude before. You’ve been in the city for a while.

SYLVIA: Yeah. Probably a couple times.

AUSTIN: He’s like a very charismatic guy. But you don’t—you tried to have meetings with him like a dozen times and he keeps deferring. Or like saying “Oh, you know, meet with my—with such-and-such, they could really—“ Like any time you ask him to have a meeting he basically pawns you off on someone who reports to him and then spins it as a sort of like “You could teach them a thing or two.” Um, so there’s a way of just like, “This is your public service.” Um—

AUSTIN (as Obelday Adelbury): Sacrifice. It’s about sacrifice. He took his own light and made us the sun. So that we might see each other. He could have kept that light. He could have—could have had that light to himself. But our lord, Samothes, he gave us... that sun. And then, as the scripture says, he gave us the hammers, and the paintbrushes, and the plows, and the pens. So that we could give of ourselves. And I ask you this, now, as you ready to leave the church. Give of yourself. Sacrifice, that our souls may be protected. In this, darkest of our times. Show him—show Samothes that you understand his sacrifice. So that he might again sacrifice his light and return that golden orb of life to the sky.

AUSTIN: And people like applaud, and shout whatever like, hallelujahs are in the church of Samothes. Um… Lots of “Yes, god”s, lots of like, “Praise him.” And on the way out they being like, you’re kind of shuffling in past them as people are leaving. And they are like giving their tithes to the church on the way out. Lots of envelopes filled with coin.

ART: We must be a sight for a halfling church. 

AUSTIN: There’s a mix of people here. 

ART (overlapping, sort of laughing): Okay.

AUSTIN: Like part of the message of Samothes in this church has been along the lines of what Lutz’s message is. Which is that like, for Rosemerrow to unify and become the center of culture in Hieron, the center of rebuilding this great continent, we need to look past our nominal differences. Right like we have to look past orc and half-elf and—and halfling, and dwarf and all of that. We just need to come together because he is our—he’s the lord of all people.

ART (overlapping): Sure.

AUSTIN: Samothes made us all, right?

ART: I’m just saying we’re some big boys.

AUSTIN (amused): You’re some big boys, though. It’s true. Um… [sort of laughs] And… You see that he’s going to his quarters. [pause] I’m guessing you follow?SYLVIA: Yeah. Yeah. [continues, overlapping, indistinguishable]

ART: Of course. 

AUSTIN: Or it’s not his quarters but like through back through the vestments—or the vestibule, and then like back around his—just kind of like a… What’s it called where—

KEITH (overlapping): A rectory.

AUSTIN: It’s connected to a church, where a priest lives? 

ART (overlapping): Um—

AUSTIN: Not a seminary, it’s another thing. 

ART: Is that what a—what’s a rectory?

AUSTIN: It’s a rectory, yeah, it’s the rectory. Yes, thank you. 

ART: Okay.

AUSTIN: And he’s like, he’s moving back to the rectory. Um… God, the fucking thing that’s about to happen.

[pause]

ART: No, it’s fine.

AUSTIN: Okay.

KEITH (overlapping with Austin): And y’all didn’t get a ten.

AUSTIN: That’s—well this wouldn’t be happening if they’d gotten a ten.

KEITH: Oh.

AUSTIN: Timing would be different.

ART: It’s fine.

AUSTIN: So—

ART: Everyone’s fine.

AUSTIN: No, they’re not, Art. [exhales] Like, you move through the rectory; the two of you can move wherever you want here. You know what I’ll give you the ten. Because you should both be getting a +1 here. 

ART (overlapping): Good point.

AUSTIN: You’re Hadrian and Ephrim, you’re both churchy pe—church boys. 

ART (overlapping): Yeah that’s—that makes sense.

AUSTIN: So yes. Whoo, everyone is fine. You find him in his back room—

KEITH (overlapping): I would like to know what was gonna happen.

AUSTIN: Oh it’s still gonna happen, they just got here first.

KEITH: Okay.

AUSTIN: That was the thing here, was like this is on the precipice, of his name being on the list.  So. You follow him to his quarters. They are extravagant but not like the church is extravagant. There’s plenty of room. He has lots of… He has like one bookshelf, like a short bookshelf, that’s filled with books, but then there are also just like—there are cabinets filled with baubles. Which are like relics of the church, as far as you know. So… Your… God, yeah let’s start with… Let’s start with your questions.

ART: Well, first off, is he evil?AUSTIN: Yes.

KEITH: Nailed it.

ART: Great.

SYLVIA: Awesome.

ART: Keith, you said that out loud.

KEITH: I also typed it in.

[Sylvia laughs]

ART (laughing): Okay.

[everyone laughs]

AUSTIN: Keith typed “Nailed” [laughter continues] If there was any question.

ART: I don’t know like, tell us about your cult.

AUSTIN: What’s that look like?

SYLVIA: Oh, I have an idea about what that looks like.

AUSTIN: Love to know.

SYLVIA: Ephrim basically grabs him. And like, puts—almost—like doesn’t quite slam him against a wall but pushes him against it. [Austin makes a vague reaction sound] And he’s just like—

AUSTIN: You don’t know—to b—I mean does Hadrian communicate [Sylvia overlaps] like “Oh, this guy’s evil.”

SYLVIA: No. No. Ephrim’s just mad. 

AUSTIN: Okay. Okay.

SYLVIA: Like Ephrim’s just like, this guy has—is—been like showing up enough places that aren’t—that he shouldn’t be showing up.

AUSTIN (overlapping): Right. Sure. Sure. 

ART: Hadrian tries to like, stop him, right.

AUSTIN (as Adelbury): This behavior is not becoming of a prince!

ART: Like holding him back, like this is a fight.

AUSTIN (laughing): “Fuck him up, Ephrim.”

[everyone laughs]

SYLVIA: Oh, shit! Completely threw me off. 

AUSTIN: Okay, sorry.

SYLVIA: No, it’s okay.

ART: Hadrian doesn’t want to be on Velasian Worldstar.

AUSTIN (overlapping): Yes.

[Sylvia snorts]

[Austin laughs]

ALI (laughing): Oh my god.

[Sylvia laughs]

AUSTIN: Oh, god…

[Ali exhales]

SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Brother, I don’t think you are in any position to lecture anyone on what is acceptable behavior.

AUSTIN (as Adelbury): Put me down and we can talk.

SYLVIA: I mean, Hadrian separated them by now so he definitely let him down, yeah.

AUSTIN: Okay.

ART (overlapping): Yeah, yeah, but—but did you?

AUSTIN (as Adelbury): Let’s all sit down and we can talk.

SYLVIA (as Ephrim): The Dark Sun. What is it? I know you’re involved.

AUSTIN (as Adelbury): It’s an old, terrible thing. I… Surprised with all of your education in the church no one told you about… About the Dark Sun. It’s just a… A cult inside of—they’ve twisted the words of our lord Samothes. I believe they’re acting inside—

ART (as Hadrian, overlapping): Who?

AUSTIN (as Adelbury): I don’t know, I don’t know anybody from the cult.

[Sylvia/Ephrim does a lip trill, kind of dismissive]

AUSTIN (as Adelbury): You know I—my understanding was that they were, operating inside of Rosemerrow. And were attempting to... go after a relic. You see I have a lot of the relics here, a lot of the—things that were touched by our lord or by people who were touched by the lord.

AUSTIN: And he like gestures towards his cabinet of baubles.

AUSTIN (as Adelbury): And I hired, uh, someone to claim that for us so that it would be safe in the church’s hands. And I just never heard back. My understanding is they got caught up in some trouble.

ART (as Hadrian): Brother. You know that Ephrim and I are supremely talented people. Servants of the lord, who are only dispatched on important matters. Please don’t waste our time with such silly lies.

AUSTIN: Is this your action?

ART: I mean it’s not a question but I’m certainly saying that.

AUSTIN: One of the—one of the things that you can do is basically call somebody out on their bullshit, to get like, more out of them.

ART: Alright, yeah, then that’s what I—I am, that’s bullshit and I don’t fuckin’… [overlapping with Austin] I’m a busy man.

AUSTIN (as Adelbury): [sighs] I don’t like your tone. You—I… Boy I’ve done more for this church than you’ve done in your life. Today—

ART (as Hadrian): The hell you have! 

SYLVIA: Hah!

AUSTIN (as Adelbury): What do you mean the hell I have? Who are you? How many people have you converted? There are ten thousand people in Rosemerrow saying “yes” to our lord’s name. You’re damn right I did more than you! You killed a few people.

ART (as Hadrian): I died for him!

AUSTIN (as Adelbury): Then you should have stayed dead, boy. Cause that was your sacrifice and you turned it back. We’re all called on to give to him. And you spit in his face by walking the earth again. Pssh.

ART: Oh, god. Oh, I want—

JACK (overlapping with Art): Fuck him up, Hadrian.

[everyone laughs]

ART: Can—can I just deck him? Like what’s the…

AUSTIN: Yes.

ART: Alright.
KEITH: I mean he’s evil, aren’t you like compelled to kill him?

ALI: Oh yeah.

AUSTIN: You are compelled to kill him.

JANINE: Ohhhh.

AUSTIN: But he still hasn’t—I was just—you’re still pushing—

JACK (overlapping with Austin): Hadrian, you’re compelled—[laughs] 

AUSTIN: You’re compelled to kill him.

ART: Yeah but there’s still information to get here. [as everyone starts talking at once] You can’t ask questions—well, I can ask questions of a dead person.

ALI (overlapping): Yeah, I was gonna say…

JACK (overlapping): Ah, that’s true, yeah.

AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah yeah yeah. You still—I think—ri—

KEITH: But when you say, “Can I just deck him?” eventually you’re gonna have to kill him, [Ali laughs] so I guess you can deck him. 

AUSTIN (overlapping with Keith): Yeah. Good.

ART (overlapping): Well I wanted the—

JACK: Yeah I guess you could absolutely like, you could Witcher it, kill him and then ask questions of him, right?

AUSTIN: You could do that.

SYLVIA: Jesus. 

KEITH: You could.

ART: I can but Ephrim can’t and Ephrim still has a [laughing] question.

[Ali laughs]

JACK: Ohh, yeah.

[Janine laughs]

DRE (amused): That’s very considerate of you. That’s very kind.

AUSTIN: I mean, I don’t know there are ten thousand people who attend his church you think maybe one or two of them have the plague? [pause] What do you think a megachurch does to something like that? 

SYLVIA (faintly): Yeah.

AUSTIN: You deck him?

ART: Yeah, we’re gonna start by just punching him. 

AUSTIN: Okay. Um, he like puts up a feeble defense and then you just hit him in the face and he like falls over. Coughs up blood and stands up and is like, looking at the rack of baubles he has. The way like, a villain in a movie looks for a gun.

ART: Hadrian’s good cop demeanor having been ruined kind of like… [Austin laughs] Like he like walks the hallway, takes a second, comes back. Like, is still too mad, steps out again. He’ll eventually be back in, he just needs a—he needs a second. 

AUSTIN (overlapping with Art): Okay. He just needed some…

SYLVIA: I actually… Ephrim wants to call Hadrian back in.

SYLVIA (as Ephrim): I need you to restrain him.

AUSTIN (overlapping): Are you—alright.

ART (as Hadrian): Oh… Okay?

SYLVIA (as Ephrim): He can’t look away from me, if I’m gonna do this.

ART (as Hadrian): Oh. Sure?

[everyone laughs a little]

SYLVIA (overlapping with laughter): And I have a move—I have a move called “Give Me Fuel, Give Me Fire.”

AUSTIN: Uh-huh.

SYLVIA: And I ask a… I’ll just read the—what it says in the book.

AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah.

SYLVIA: “When you gaze intensely into someone’s eyes you may ask their player ‘What fuels the  flames of your desire.’ They’ll answer the truth even if the character does not know or would otherwise keep this hidden.”

AUSTIN: Mhmm. Give me a roll on that. 

KEITH (overlapping): Is there a failure?

SYLVIA (overlapping): I d—there’s—there’s no—there’s no roll.

AUSTIN (overlapping): Oh, there isn’t one. Yeah. Okay. Good.

SYLVIA: It’s just, you—I do it, as long as I can stare into their eyes.

JACK (overlapping): Oh god…

AUSTIN: Yeah. That’s so good.

KEITH: Ah, that’s great.

AUSTIN: Alright. Um… What’s this look like?

SYLVIA: Um… The way I see it is like… Like I said, I need Hadrian to hold him d—like, hold him steady. And… Ephrim get—like—takes—like gets down on a knee, so he’s at eye level with him. 

AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah. Mhmm. Mhmm.

SYLVIA: And he just asks like,

SYLVIA (as Ephrim): What do you want here?

SYLVIA: And like, just like, peers into him, basically. With the—and he’s compelled. There’s almost like a spark of flame in his eyes when he does it.

AUSTIN: Right. He says,

AUSTIN (as Adelbury): My prince, we do not have much time left. The sun is gone, and the dark sun is rising. There will not be much time… before all of us are called to make a choice, about what the future holds. I want to live comfortably until then. And I want people, whatever their cost is, to help me do that.

SYLVIA (as Ephrim): You’re pathetic.

AUSTIN (as Adelbury): I’m comfortable.

SYLVIA (as Ephrim, overlapping with Austin/Adelbury some): You’ve spent so much time, you and everyone else who knows about this Heat and the Dark has been so afraid of it, they haven’t noticed that they true heat they need to fear has been right in front of them this entire time.

ART (dramatic fake-whisper): Oh, that would be a badass thing to say before you burn someone to death.

[Ali snorts]

SYLVIA: Oh yeah no that’s—I’m gonna—can I roll my Burning Brand?

AUSTIN: Oh, you can just kill him.

SYLVIA: Yeah, okay. And so Ephrim makes a blade of fire that comes out of the right hand and just stabs him with it.

AUSTIN: Okay. Does—both of you give me… a Defy Danger—

ART (overlapping with Austin): Does it—does it immolate the corpse?

AUSTIN: N—I don’t—

SYLVIA: It acts like a… blade.

AUSTIN: What did you do?

JACK (overlapping with Austin): Oh, no.

AUSTIN: I don’t know what it does. Give me a Defy Danger wisdom. You kill him, this is not a thing about whether or not you kill him. You kill him. There is probably a corpse left. It’s charred and bad.

SYLVIA (overlapping): Ugh, I just [indistinguishable].

AUSTIN: Okay?

SYLVIA: I mean, he held him—to answer Ali’s question, [Ali laughs] he held him.

AUSTIN: He did held—he did hold him. 

ALI (laughing): Okay.

KEITH: He was an accessory to murder.

AUSTIN: Okay.

ALI: I’m just wondering if Hadrian’s getting the like, Samothes approval, that’s…

AUSTIN: No, that’s not what this is at all.

ALI (overlapping): Aw. Aww.

ART: No, that’s not what this is. Samothes told me I couldn’t not—I couldn’t—I can’t let him live per Samothes. Samothes did not like the last time I killed someone in charge of a conspiracy.

AUSTIN: Mhmm. Um…

JACK: Aw, Samothes hated that.

AUSTIN: Samothes was not a fan.

ART: Aw yeah, he was not a fan.

AUSTIN: So, Hadrian you hear the door open. But you don’t have time to react, but you do get to see… An elven man in a purple robe walk in. With his hair tied behind his head and glasses up on his nose. [Jack takes a deep breath] And he goes,

AUSTIN (as Fantasmo): What is going on here?
AUSTIN: And it’s—it’s Fantasmo.

JACK: Huh.

ART (as Hadrian): Church business.

[Dre laughs in background]

AUSTIN (as Fantasmo): You’ve killed this man. 

[Keith laughs]

ART (as Hadrian): Sure have.

SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Oh, I’ve—I’ve been waiting to see you again.

AUSTIN (as Fantasmo): I—he had information—he had information I needed. I’m very close to tracking down this killer.

[Sylvia/Ephrim laughs]

ART (as Hadrian): Oh, buddy.

SYLVIA: Ohh.

ART (as Hadrian): Um… You wanna—you wanna talk about this? We can… We can go back to town. 

AUSTIN (as Fantasmo): I had—no, it’s… He’s gonna be here any minute. And I needed information so that I knew how to stop him.

ART (as Hadrian): Who?
AUSTIN (as Fantasmo): Arrel.

ART (as Hadrian, a little sadly): Oh, buddy. [pause] Look… It’s okay.

AUSTIN (as Fantasmo): Why are you looking at me like that?

SYLVIA (as Ephrim, softly): He really doesn’t know.

ART (as Hadrian): He really doesn’t. Look, I… 

[Austin, ambiguously in-character, gives an ominous soft laugh]

ART (as Hadrian): I need you to—I need you to just stay—just stay calm.

AUSTIN: [laughs again] This is precious.

AUSTIN: Says a voice in the room. 

AUSTIN (as Fantasmo): Who was that voice? Is this also “church business”?

SYLVIA (as Ephrim): I mean…

[Austin snorts]

ART (unclear if in-character): No. 

SYLVIA (as Ephrim): If I were to be completely honest, I guess the answer would be you. 

AUSTIN: Fantasmo begins to cast a spell. 

ART: Uh, can I “I Am the Law” him?

AUSTIN: Yeah. 

ART: Uh… 

ART (as Hadrian): Fantasmo, please. Not only as your friend, but as a—as a representative of the church, and someone who speaks with divine authority, stop what you’re doing now.

AUSTIN: Give me a roll. [pause] Uh, he’s going to roll to—

ART (overlapping): That’s charisma, right?

AUSTIN: He’s going to roll to interfere.
ART: Yeah. And I did a bad job.

AUSTIN: What did you get—what’d you get?

ALI: Nine.

AUSTIN: Nine’s alright.

SYLVIA (overlapping): I should—I should—I shoulda aided—whatever.

ART: Wait didn’t we decide that you can aid after the fact now? 

ALI: Yeah. 

AUSTIN: Yeah, you can aid after the fact.

SYLVIA: Okay. Um. I just roll 2d6, I have no bond with him, right?

AUSTIN: Yeah. And there’s no bond here either.

SYLVIA: Ugh. 

AUSTIN: That means you open yourself up to repercussion. 

JACK: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Ope, he doesn’t—it doesn’t work for him either. This is a shame. [Janine laughs] Oh, boy. Oh, Fantasmo. Um, let me look closer at this…

ART: Oh I get—one… Is it one forward with him?

AUSTIN: Yeah, what do you get—so you take one forward with him. 

ART: Uh… Oh no, I don’t get one forward, it’s just they choose one.

AUSTIN (overlapping): How’s—

ART: Do what I say, back away cautiously and then flee, or attack. I think he was attack—in the process of attacking me, so.

AUSTIN: What are the three things again, say them again?

ART: They can comply with my—with my request. 

AUSTIN (overlapping): Mhm.

ART: Order, really. They can back cautiously and then flee.

AUSTIN: Mhm.

ART: Or they can attack.

AUSTIN: [exhales] He complies. And like lowers his staff. 
ART: Great.

AUSTIN (as Fantasmo): I need to know… What is going on?

[pause]

SYLVIA (as Ephrim): You may wanna sit down.

ART (as Hadrian, sincerely): Yeah.

AUSTIN (as an unidentified voice): No, you know what, no more of this.

AUSTIN: And then Fantasmo like a sheet, falls to the ground. Like a sheet of skin. Like someone—like his head was a balloon and someone popped it.

ALI (disapproving/uncomfortable): Mmmm.

ART: Uugh!

AUSTIN (overlapping): And the rest of it fell.

[Janine laughs]

AUSTIN: No blood, just—he deflated. 

ART: No blood, no bones.

JANINE: Like a reverse weaver.

[Ali snorts]

AUSTIN: Yeah.

[Sylvia scoffs]

KEITH: Weavers, who are only blood and bones.

[Janine laughs softly]

AUSTIN (as Arrel): In any case you’ve done my job for me. So, thank you very much.

ART (as Hadrian): I thought you needed him in your pocket dimension?
AUSTIN (as Arrel): No, that was just—you know, that would have been fine too. I didn’t have it in me to draw his blood but… I did need him out of the way. The Dark Sun can’t have what I’m looking for.

AUSTIN: This is just a voice still.

ART: Yeah. Um… I wonder—no, never mind.

KEITH (overlapping): Um, would—

ART: I was wondering if I could “I Am the Law” the voice. 

AUSTIN: Mm.

KEITH (overlapping): Would—

ART: And the answer’s “probably,” but we’re gettin’ boring at that point. [pause] Let me—let me pull up my spells real quick…

AUSTIN (as Arrel): I mean you shoulda let him cast Detect Magic if you wanted to see me. [pause] Oh you thought he was attacking you? No. 

ART (as Hadrian): I—I did.

AUSTIN (as Arrel): No, it didn’t… He was—

ART (as Hadrian): You know, I preferred Fantasmo’s brand of condescension. 

AUSTIN (as Arrel): Fantasmo was like really afraid of you, Hadrian. Like, deeply afraid of you. He would have never attacked you.

ART (as Hadrian): That’s ridiculous. I saw him destroy a universe once.

AUSTIN (as Arrel): He did that by mistake. It was useful, though. I didn’t know that that’s how… I hadn’t thought about universes like that yet. Anyway.

ART (very faintly, ambiguously in-character): Jesus.

AUSTIN (as Arrel): Let me make you the offer. How about this. I’ll come out. And we can talk.

ART (as Hadrian): Okay?

AUSTIN: And like… The like… Skin sheet reforms itself. And there is a man, who’s like a little buffer than Fantasmo was, a little bit more built. But still a half-elf. Instead of the ponytail he has kind of close-cropped salt-and-pepper hair. A squarer jaw. And, like just a firmer stance. And he… Nods to both of you.

[pause]

ART: Uh—

AUSTIN (overlapping):  What—

ART: Can I cast a spell real quick?

AUSTIN: Sure.

ART: I’d like to cast Sanctuary?

AUSTIN: Sure. What’s that do.

ART: Which will alert me—uh, “To cast the spell you walk the perimeter of an area—“ I’m gonna try to—

AUSTIN: Yeah. Kind of just like stealthily, circle this dude.

ART (overlapping): Yeah. Yeah.

AUSTIN: Sure.

ART: Consecrate it to my deity, “as long as you stay within that area you are alerted whenever someone acts with malice within the sanctuary.”

AUSTIN: Good call.

ART: “Including entering with harmful intent.”

AUSTIN: Mhmm.

ART: I hope it gives us like a warning if he’s like, “Now you all die.”

AUSTIN: Yes. I would give you that. Give me a roll.

ART: Here is my roll. I’m still not great at this.

AUSTIN (overlapping): Eh, you got a seven.

ART: That’s a seven.

AUSTIN: So do you forget the spell, take one—minus one forward on casting, or… Whatever the third one is.

ART (overlapping): Uhh.

AUSTIN: Draw unwanted—draw negative attention to yourself.

ART: Let’s not do that one.

SYLVIA: Maybe not. 

AUSTIN: Okay, cause there’s still more negative attention in this scene, but you know.

ART: I never doubt your ability [everyone laughs] to create negative attention.

AUSTIN (overlapping): Uh-huh. 

ART: I just wanted you to know, that I… believe in you.

AUSTIN: Thank you. 

ART: I’ll say that casting distances me from my deity, take -1 ongoing to cast a spell. I sort of like really drew the attention of Samothes to this room where I killed his guy.

AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah. Mhmm.

ART: Or, you know, assisted—

AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah. 

ART: Was an accessory to guy murder.

AUSTIN: There’s no malice. Inside of the circle right now. Unless one of you happens to have malice. Ephrim?

ART (overlapping): No no, it’ll just—it’s ongoing—I’ll be alerted to it.

SYLVIA: Ehh. Ephrim’s still—

AUSTIN: What here has malice?

SYLVIA: Ephrim—I mean… I—I wouldn’t say that it’s malice that would be acted on. But Ephrim is like, staring daggers into Arrel. If that counts.

AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah. Mhhm. Okay.

SYLVIA: Also I—I just wanna note that his brand is still out, like he’s on the…

AUSTIN (overlapping some): Yeah. Does it just look like a sword right now?

SYLVIA: No, um… It looks like a… A scythe blade, but it’s coming out of his hand.
AUSTIN: Okay. Great. Um… 

AUSTIN (as Arrel): Alright. Let me lay this out for you. I know you’ve been to my study. And I appreciate that you went there, and you read about how I got here. It’s been a long trip. [pause] Do you get what’s coming next, for Hieron? Hieron floats in a void. There’s nothing around it. Except that there is something around it, and that something is the nothing, around it. And that is closing in. It’s—it’s—you know… It abhors us. It doesn’t hate, but it opposes that we exist. And it is bigger than any sword, older than any spell. And I see a way to, if not defeat it, at least let people live… joyously, until it finally consumes us. And I’d be giving them more time, than they would have, otherwise. That’s the long and short. I could lay out the Heat and the Dark for you in greater detail if you wish. I can talk to you about the incursions that it has made on the world. Ephrim, how much do you remember, about the East? Your childhood?

SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Enough.

AUSTIN (as Arrel): You ever wonder why you were traveling so often? Every other day was a new village, a new stop?
 
SYLVIA (as Ephrim, emphatically): That was to teach me.
 
AUSTIN (as Arrel): Mm. If you really wanted to learn you would have stayed in one place. The Heat and the Dark has torn the world [sort of laughs] there into bits and pieces. And, it—to its credit, it stitches itself back together, but it is anything but… Stable. [pause] And every year it gets closer. [pause] And eventually, it will not stitch itself back together. [pause] And after that I could tell you what I guess comes next. But I… can’t be sure, and I don’t like making… Leaps of logic. In that way Fantasmo was very much like me.
 
SYLVIA (as Ephrim): There’s another way that he was much like you. You’re both too scared to do anything, anything of substance.
 
AUSTIN (as Arrel): What would you do? Tell me what you would do to stop the Heat and the Dark, Ephrim.
 
SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Well. [sighs] Considering I just have learned ab—
 
AUSTIN (as Arrel, overlapping): Tell me, if you have an alternative, I would love to hear about it. I’ve devoted sixty years of my life to it.
 
SYLVIA (as Ephrim, overlapping): I’m going—
 
AUSTIN (as Arrel): Sixty. I st—I thought about fighting it for thirty years. And then I thought about an alternative for another twenty-five. And then I gave up. And then… The book. And then, the dimensions. I—I—I don’t oppose the notion of doing something else, if you give me an alternative I will pursue it.
 
[pause]
 
SYLVIA (as Ephrim): There has to be something more, than just putting people away, in these… bubbles, that you’ve put them in. There has to be something more than that!
 
AUSTIN (as Arrel): Now who sounds scared. [Sylvia/Ephrim sighs] Why ought there be something instead of nothing? There is no natural law. And whatever power things like Samothes once had to protect us from that, they don’t seem to be enacting it now.
 
ART (as Hadrian): That’s the answer to your question. That’s why there’s something instead of nothing. Divine power. And we should protect [Austin/Arrel sort of scoffs] what they’ve established.
 
AUSTIN (as Arrel): [sighs] I’m protecting it as best I can. Inside of… those bubbles as you call them, there’s a chance for us to find something else. I’ll be in one too, eventually, and I’ll have—in my estimation, a thousand years, of study. Wh—in what would only be normally another hundred or so. Do you understand that? If I had a child today it would live to see the end of Hieron. I’m not talking about something that will come one distant day. People you know will be alive when it happens. I have no ill will towards you. I have no ill will towards anyone. If you were higher on my list, I would save you from it now. But… Time is limited. And there are others I wish to save first.
 
ART (as Hadrian): This guy?
 
[Sylvia laughs]
 
AUSTIN (as Arrel): No no no, to be clear again, he was Dark Sun. And if he had gotten something, that was uh… dangerous, he would have turned a hundred years into fifty or twenty or ten! I was putting him in a dimension so that he could think it over. Confront his own guilt. And maybe in a hundred or two hundred years, put his charisma towards better use. In thinking about how to contribute to our savior. Do you have anything else for me? Cause I’m very busy.
 
ART: [snorts] This a really childish situation of like “You’re wrong about this, and I don’t know why yet [Austin “mhmm”s] but like [Ali laughs softly] just go, and we’ll figure it—” [laughing] that’s, I can’t say any of it. Umm. Oh, what here is evil?
 
AUSTIN: Nothing anymore. [pause] This isn’t selfishness, this isn’t like—it’s—it’s... wrong. I think it’s wrong. I think this is an incorrect—like Austin Walker thinks this is an incorrect thing to do. But I don’t think it’s evil, I think it’s… Some other thing.
 
ART (overlapping some): Okay so metaphysically, everyone’s okay with… Him putting people in these bubbles? 
 
AUSTIN: N—no, not necessarily. But they think that it like—I think he probably comes down as like, lawful. Or something. Not as evil.
 
ART: ‘Kay.
 
AUSTIN: Right?
 
ART (kind of unconvinced): Alright. I mean, I don’t know.
 
AUSTIN (overlapping): Maybe neutral? Alright.
 
ART: Alright.
 
AUSTIN: Um…
 
KEITH: I mean he’s—he seems like he’s trying to save the world, so lawful might be the…
 
AUSTIN: Right. And I think it’s specifically about finding a way to maintain the order of the world, and not about… He doesn’t gain from this outside of continuing to exist.
 
KEITH: Right.
 
AUSTIN: And like if he wanted to he could just put himself in one of these bubbles. And probably spend a lot more time just doing that. 
 
ART: But he’s like taking people without their consent [Austin overlaps] and like imprisoning them in thousand-year bubbles.
 
AUSTIN (overlapping): Yes, that’s bad. 100%.
 
SYLVIA (overlapping): Yeah.
 
AUSTIN: Well, as far as you know without their consent. You didn’t talk to Lutz. You didn’t talk to—to—I guess no one’s seen…
 
ALI: I guess it’s a case-by-case thing?
 
AUSTIN: Yeah, it’s a case-by-case thing.
 
ART: Well how many people do you gotta put in bubbles before you’re evil, I mean—
 
AUSTIN (overlapping some): It’s one. It’s—well, I don’t know. I don’t know. Like… 
 
ART: Alright. But it’s not—
 
AUSTIN (overlapping): For ma—I—he can even—he can even tell you this, which is for many people they can live out [laughs] a long life not knowing they’re in these bubbles. Which is weird.
 
ART: How do you not know you’re in a bubble?

AUSTIN: Cause it’s just the world in there.
 
ART: But there’s no one else there.
 
AUSTIN: No—no no, of course there is.
 
ART: Oh.
 
AUSTIN: They’re just the people—
 
ART (overlapping): I thought it was everyone gets their own bubble. [overlapping with Austin] It’s like a—
 
AUSTIN: They do, and it’s filled with a projection of the world that they believe exists.
 
KEITH: Yeah. Last recording you—you described it as like, solipsistic, where it’s—
 
AUSTIN: It is solipsistic in that it is the world created by that personal mind.
 
KEITH: Right, yeah.
 
AUSTIN: Yeah yeah yeah.
 
ALI: Ohhhhh.
 
ART (overlapping with Ali): Alright, I didn’t—I didn’t appreciate that they included other people.
 
ALI (overlapping with Art): I didn’t get that.
 
AUSTIN (slipping into character): This isn’t a cell—I’m not trapping people in a cell where they’ll have to, like, do their homework. 
 
[Art and Keith laugh] 
 
ALI (overlapping): Sounds alright.
 
AUSTIN (as Arrel): It’s—it’s the world. And it’s the world they want it to be. Maybe they don’t want to contribute at all. Maybe they want to reshape the world in their image. Good, fine. We have limited time left, let them. 
 
ART (as Hadrian): Now, that’s not… You have to fight.
 
AUSTIN (as Arrel): Okay. I’ve heard that from you. [sighs] I’ve heard that from a lot of people. There was a man a long time ago who believed that, too. I read about him. I’ve met him. He’s a good friend. Anyway… I think it’s a noble thing that he wants to fight too. That he wanted to fight then. I think he’s wrong. And one day I’ll save him too. And he’ll thank me.
 
ART (vaguely in character as Hadrian): That’ll be an interesting fucking day, I don’t know who you’re talking about but some people do and they’re tickled by this right now.
 
AUSTIN (overlapping with Art): It’s—it’s Samot, it’s Samot, it’s Samot.
 
[Janine laughs]
 
ART (overlapping with Ali): I know.
 
AUSTIN (overlapping with Ali): Oh.
 
ALI: How was he not at the top of the list?
 
[Art laughs]
 
AUSTIN (overlapping with laughter): Cause he’s in like a different—cause he’s all the way in the City of Light. That’s far.
 
ART: I know it’s Samot, I don’t think Hadrian knows.
 
AUSTIN: Gotcha. Yes.
 
KEITH (overlapping with Austin some): He’s a wizard not a fuckin’ magician.
 
AUSTIN: Yes. Come on. [Keith and Ali laugh] One thing at a time. Like, please.
 
JACK: Also like, even—yeah, even getting to Marielda’s gotta be really difficult now, right?
 
AUSTIN: Yes.
 
JACK: Like, way harder than it used to be.
 
AUSTIN: Yes. [pause] Alright.
 
ART: Yeah I guess—I mean, I’m not—we’re not gonna fight him.
 
SYLVIA (overlapping): Yeah.
 
ART: And, I think we’re done talking to him. Unless he’s not done with us, I mean…
 
AUSTIN: Eh, he’s plenty done.
 
ALI: Is there—mm.
 
SYLVIA (overlapping with Ali): I have one last thing to say to him before he leaves.
 
AUSTIN: Mhhm?
 
SYLVIA (as Ephrim): Arrel. If I see you again, the Heat and the Dark is going to be the least of your worries.
 
AUSTIN: Okay. And he just leaves [sort of laughs] like, unimpressed.
 
ART: You’ll show him the heat? Huh? Hm?
 
SYLVIA: Yeah. I mean, I already used that one, so I…
 
AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah.
 
ART: Oh right, sorry. 
 
SYLVIAAND (overlapping): Didn’t wanna do it again, so, kind of flounders there. But you know.
 
AUSTIN: Alright. Let’s… Let’s go to the next… Scene. Cause time is—
 
ART: I think I resolved a bond. [kind of laughs]
 
AUSTIN: Yeah.
 
[Art laughs]
 
AUSTIN: Somehow.
 
KEITH: What was—wait, what was the bond?
 
ART: “Fantasmo saved my life and returned my faith to me. I owe him one.”
 
ALI: Aww.
 
AUSTIN (sadly): Mmm.
 
KEITH: Mmmm.

[pause]
 
ART: I tried!
 
AUSTIN: You did.
 
ALI (sadly): Yeah.
 
SYLVIA: Yeah. No, you did.
 
AUSTIN: Throndir. Fero.
 
KEITH: Yes.
 
DRE (overlapping): Okay, yeah.
 
AUSTIN: Give me a roll.
 
KEITH: Alright. So we’re gettin—we’re gettin a +3, I bet?
 
AUSTIN: You’re getting a—yeah, +3, that would be the bonus for you being there, yes.
 
DRE: [overlapping] Yeah. [no longer overlapping] Well, and you get a +1 for your coffee, don’t you?
 
AUSTIN: Oh shit, it’s a +4.
 
ALI: Should that be for this, or for that be for another…
 
KEITH (overlapping): Okay, +4.
 
AUSTIN: It’s for the next roll.
 
KEITH (overlapping): I don’t think I can save it, it’s the next roll.
 
ALI (overlapping): Oh.
 
AUSTIN: Yeah. It’s a forward, it’s not a hold. 
 
KEITH: Oh—slash—oh!
 
AUSTIN: +4. It would have to go really bad.
 
KEITH: Fourteen!
 
AUSTIN: Okay.
 
DRE: Jesus!
 
AUSTIN: Whoof. Two for one.
 
KEITH: Yeahh.
 
AUSTIN: Alright, okay. Yeah. I—they are holding Mother Glory in a basement. Um. There’s a guard who’s just like, 
 
AUSTIN (as guard): She thrashed around a lot when we first got her but she seems to have calmed down as soon as she heard the news. Couple more hours, it’ll all be done for her.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Oh, shut up. You suck.
 
AUSTIN (as guard): You know. She shouldn’t have killed our chancellor.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Ah, shut up, you suck, get out of here.
 
DRE (as Throndir): Also, she didn’t do that. But he’s right, you suck.
 
AUSTIN (as guard): How do you know she didn’t do that? We caught her doing it.
 
KEITH (as Fero, overlapping): Cause we’re detectives, it’s our fucking job, you suck, shut up.
 
AUSTIN (as guard): You’re not a detective. What are you talking about?
 
KEITH (as Fero, overlapping): Yeah, look at—I got a badge.
 
AUSTIN (as guard, overlapping with Dre/Throndir): I got a badge—
 
DRE (as Throndir): I got a badge too. And my dog’s got a badge.
 
AUSTIN (as guard): No, that’s not true at all. Your dog does not have a badge. Now you’re a liar, not a detective.
 
DRE (overlapping with Austin): Oh, that’s right, we gave away my dog badge.
 
KEITH (as Fero): It must have fallen off. We got in a fight with a star.
 
AUSTIN (as guard): And now I know you’re both liars.
 
KEITH: I wanna stomp on his foot.
 
AUSTIN (as guard): Oh—a-ah—
 
AUSTIN: That was the sound he made.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Shut up, you suck. 
 
AUSTIN (as guard): I don’t have to let you in if you’re gonna be like this.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Move it.
 
KEITH: And I just walk in.
 
AUSTIN: You’re in a—so now you’re in the village center. And it’s like empty in here? It’s like conspicuously empty. Uh, it’s just like a collection of small rooms, there’s like the big—there’s like a bunch of side rooms that are offices and there’s one big meeting hall and then eventually you find like the basement door which has been bolted and there are like four cabinets in front of it.
 
KEITH (overlapping): Mhmm.
 
AUSTIN: There are holes in the—like, the floor, that have been, like um, patched over with like, metal, where it’s clear Mother Glory broke through.
 
KEITH: Umm. And she’s inside the…
 
AUSTIN: Basement.
 
KEITH: Basement. Okay. Is there anybody like guarding it or we can just go—we can just go in?
 
AUSTIN: Nah, the whole place is empty at this point.
 
KEITH: Oh okay. Well then yeah. I’ll head in. 
 
AUSTIN: Outside, they’re—they are preparing a pyre.
 
KEITH: Oof.
 
[pause]
 
AUSTIN: So you move all the furniture out of the way of the door, and unbolt it, and head downstairs, and she’s sitting there on the ground, legs crossed, wounded badly. Not badly like she’s dying, badly like she’s lost a lot of her strength. Like a bear who’s been shot with a bunch of arrows.
 
KEITH (overlapping): Okay. Is she also physically wounded?
 
AUSTIN: Yeah yeah yeah.
 
KEITH: Okay. I can heal her.
 
AUSTIN: She has like broken arrow shafts and stuff in her—she has like—there’s a broken spear that was like—the just—the top of it is in her shoulder. [Keith mhmms] She’s like very hurt.
 
KEITH: I can heal her.
 
AUSTIN: Okay.
 
KEITH: With uhh, I have three balance, I think it’s 1d4 per balance.
 
AUSTIN: Give me a roll.

KEITH: Wait, I’m gonna ch—just gonna double-check the numbers. Uuum.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): Fero.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Hey.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): Who’s your friend?
 
KEITH (as Fero): Uhh… This is Throndir. He has a—he’s got a dog, and he seems to be a nice guy.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): Are you sure that dog’s… not one of us? [pause] It’s a big dog.
 
KEITH (as Fero): It is a big dog.
 
DRE (as Throndir, overlapping with Keith/Fero): I’ve asked him. 
 
KEITH (as Fero): No no no, it’s—he’s not… Hey I can heal some of your stuff there.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): [scoffs softly] Okay.
 
KEITH: I heal her seven. There.
 
AUSTIN: That’s… She’s still hurt pretty bad. 
 
KEITH: Seven’s a lot!
 
AUSTIN: Seven’s a lot but that’s still like, not—she’s still not above half HP.
 
KEITH: Okay.

DRE: Oof.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): [sighs] Thank you though.
 
[pause]
 
KEITH: Uh—
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): Fero, they’re going to kill me.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Ah, nah, we can get you out of here.
 
[pause]
 
[AUSTIN as Mother Glory scoffs quietly, sighs]
 
AUSTIN: She sighs.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): I was supposed to meet with Lutz. I should’ve known. I should’ve known, that this was going to happen.
 
KEITH: Hey did—I mean—[dropping out of character] wait, I’m not ask this if it counts as my question. I assume this is small talk cause I know the answer.
 
AUSTIN: Mhm.
 
KEITH (as Fero): You didn’t knock—you didn’t like run away, knock over an apple cart, and apologize for it?
 
AUSTIN: She just shakes her head.
 
KEITH: Yeah.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Cool. Yeah, you didn’t do it.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): That’s not going to convince them.
 
KEITH: What—what uhhhh… What is the bonus that we get?
 
AUSTIN: [sighs] She… says,
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): I hid it in the mills. The contract, the First Contract.
 
KEITH (as Fero, overlapping): Ooh.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): If you can get it to someone, then after I’m gone, it—it might still mean—I don’t know. You could start to build something around that contract.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Did Lutz give it to you?
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): No, we took it from the New Old Museum, together, we got high. Maybe that’s why you don’t remember very well.
 
KEITH (as Fero, overlapping): Oh, right. Yeah yeah yeah yeah.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory, overlapping): We found it together, and then we kept it—
 
KEITH (as Fero, very quickly): No no no no no no, I remember it. 
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): Okay.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Did you show it to Lutz, and then Lutz was like, “This is cool.”
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): No I was on my way. I was on my way—
 
KEITH (as Fero, overlapping): Oh, you never even met Lutz.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): Right.
 
KEITH (as Fero): And what happened?
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): I saw the explosions… and it felt like a setup. And I turned and ran.

KEITH (as Fero): Huh.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): And they caught me in the fields. I should’ve never gone. I should’ve insisted he meet me.
 
KEITH (as Fero, overlapping): Yeah.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): In the woods.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Well, you couldn’t have known, this is… Seems like it was a very well-orchestrated setup.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): I don’t care how orchestrated it is. I care that my people are going to lose a leader.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Nah, I—[indistinguishable] I mean, if they don’t let you out, I’m just gonna break you out. What are they gonna do, be mad at me? Fine.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): [sighs] That will do wonders for the cause, Fero.
 
KEITH (as Fero): I mean it seems like it’s two bad situations, maybe?

AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): One bad situation is I die, the other is all of my people do. What—[deep breath] I didn’t get here because I broke things. I got here because I broke the right things.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Mmmm. The first time we met there was a lotta stuff you were trying to break.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): The right things.
 
[pause]
 
KEITH (as Fero):  I don’t know, it was like a mayor, right? What’s Lenny? He’s a m—
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): He’s a shithead, isn’t he? Who cares about him.
 
KEITH (as Fero): He’s a real fuckin’ dickbag. I hate that guy.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): But Lutz was good. 
 
KEITH (as Fero): Yeah.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): Or better than most. He meant good.
 
KEITH (as Fero, overlapping some): Yeah, that’s what I heard. I don’t think that I’ve met Lutz. 
 
AUSTIN: Probably not.
 
DRE (as Throndir): He may not be dead.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): What?
 
KEITH (as Fero): Right, that’s a good point. Yeah so Lutz might not be dead, he might just be in a—in a pocket universe.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): Okay, I…
 
DRE (as Throndir): There’s—there’s a lot going on here.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Yeah.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): Is that like the place we went under the museum?
 
KEITH (as Fero, uncertainly): Mmmm. Probably?

AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): Okay. [deep breath] Well if you find him and get him back then… Then maybe you could save me.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Yeah, if I do that… Maybe I could do that. [pause] Hey where’s the person in charge of the execution stuff, maybe I could have them like, hold off. I’ve got a badge.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): They’ve already announced it.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Well, they can—
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory, overlapping): They’re not gonna move it for you.
 
KEITH (as Fero): I can give it a try. There’s—there’s also Throndir. We’ve got two people that have badges.
 
DRE (as Throndir): It’s true.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): And thousands that want to see me burn. And they—
 
KEITH (as Fero, overlapping some): That’s gross. People are so gross.
 
[pause]
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): When I’m gone will you stay and fight? I don’t mean punches, or becoming a bear.
 
KEITH (as Fero): You mean like, uh…
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): I mean like with the contract.
 
KEITH (as Fero, overlapping): Becoming like a, other thing?
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory, sort of laughing): Yeah. Another thing. 
 
KEITH (as Fero): Like a eagle?
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): Mm. Like a s—like symbolically, maybe.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Okay.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): Like that would—I can imagine you as like an eagle and then you land and you’re on a podium and then you say like, good words, and then you negotiate a trade deal, or a… Safety for my people.
 
KEITH (as Fero): I can tr—here’s the thing. Ev—we might—everyone might die. In the whole world.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): That’s—yeah. Welcome to Tesday.
 
KEITH (as Fero): So I have to also consider that. Um… But I’m—I’ll give you a tentative yes.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory, overlapping): Oh.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Based on the understanding, that I’m gonna fucking get you outta here anyway. 
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): Mmm. I see. No, it’s fine. 
 
AUSTIN: And she like… Begins to play with a necklace, like she has like a beaded necklace that she starts counting on. [pause] You have two questions.
 
KEITH: Dre, do you wanna go first?
 
DRE: Umm… This may be too broad but, how can we stop them from killing Mother Glory?
 
AUSTIN: You could provide Lutz. You could… [sighs] You could have someone who has the authority to intercede, intercede. Um—at this point that would be the chancellor, or the Major Crimes Division.
 
KEITH: Who’s the chancellor?
 
AUSTIN: Lutz. It was Lutz.
 
KEITH (overlapping): Oh right well yeah. I thought maybe there was an interim chancellor.
 
AUSTIN: Um. But they will fight you t—like you can’t just say “No, don’t kill her.” Yeah or Hella in the chat says “Ordenna” but like, they don’t have the authority to do that, it would be—
 
DRE (overlapping): They have the power.
 
AUSTIN: They have the power to do it, and it would be a diplomatic—it would be a real—it would be a real problem. [Ali laughs] There is a person in Ordenna—so—so yeah, I think Mother Glory says like,
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): Lutz could stop it. Or… 
 
AUSTIN: She’s like, again, counting on her kind of like, beaded necklace here.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): I guess… Jerod. Jerod Shiraz. The Vicereine. The Ordennans. She could maybe… Take me as a political prisoner. Or—
 
KEITH (as Fero): Mmm.
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): By force. It would be by force.
 
KEITH (as Fero): Anyone we can get to in one turn?
 
[Keith and Dre laugh]
 
AUSTIN (as Mother Glory): There’s… [long pause] Not that I [laughing] can think of. Not you, anyway. There’s Bray Tevilton in the mills, is the chief of the Major Crimes Unit. Major Crimes Division. He might be able to stop them, if you ask quickly. [exhales]
 
KEITH (as Fero): Well… Hmm. 
 
AUSTIN: I’m trying to think if there’s anybody else. Ordenna could do it if you could convince them. And yeah, you could convince either… Uh… The—Jerod, Jerod Shiraz, who’s the, kind of the civil and spiritual leader of Ordenna.
 
ALI: Could—
 
AUSTIN: You could—go ahead.
 
ALI: Could I lie enough about having Ordennan pull to like—if Hella went there?

AUSTIN: No no no. They can do it because they have the anchor. Who will march in a kill people and like, take her.
 
KEITH (overlapping): Yeah.
 
ALI (overlapping): Okay. I have the plates though.
 
AUSTIN: So yeah, you could lead a bunch of [Ali overlaps] anchors. You could steal a bunch of anchors—
 
ALI (overlapping): Mmmgh.
 
DRE (overlapping): Oh, hell yeah.
 
[Ali laughs]
 
AUSTIN: And then kill a bunch of people.
 
KEITH: See that—see that doesn’t sound like a good idea.
 
AUSTIN (overlapping with Keith): Yeah. Viridian—Viridian Village, you’re right you are in Viridian Village. So yeah, Jerod Shiraz, you could convince her to do it. Um [laughs] but, I think somebody else maybe has already explained that she is here to like prevent stuff going off? 
 
ALI (overlapping): Right, yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah.
 
AUSTIN: So. But hey, you could give it a shot.
 
ALI: No. Yeah. 
 
KEITH: That also—again I don’t think that having an enemy army march in, kill a bunch of people, is a great trade.
 
ALI: Right.
 
DRE: You said it yourself, Keith, they suck.
 
KEITH (overlapping with Ali): They—well the Ordennans suck too.
 
ALI (overlapping): No, yeah, but.
 
[Dre laughs]
 
AUSTIN: Mhmm. Everyone who isn’t Fero sucks.
 
ALI: Uh-huh.
 
KEITH: Kind of! [pause] I like most of the people that are in the party.
 
[Dre laughs]
 
KEITH: Um… Alright. So I know we’ve been over this before, you’re saying… Can’t break Mother Glory out of jail. And ride her…
 
AUSTIN (overlapping with Keith some): I mean you could totally—she doesn’t want to be broken out of jail. She’s not gonna let you break her out of jail. Like…
 
KEITH: Even if we went and got Lutz?
 
DRE (overlapping with Austin): That’s not breaking her out.
 
AUSTIN: Lutz wouldn’t be breaking her out of jail. He would be like, pardoning her.
 
ALI: Yeah.
 
KEITH: Right, but I’m just saying like, break her out of jail—
 
AUSTIN (overlapping): And proving that she didn’t kill him.
 
KEITH: Break her out of jail, go get Lutz, and it’s like, okay party.
 
AUSTIN: No cause like, by the time you go get Lutz, how many of her people will be killed, in the witch hunt for her? Like, no. If somebody else takes her, then like, that’s a weird other thing? Like if Ordenna takes her then that’s not the gknolls—like people will still talk shit about the gknolls and be like “Ugh, I thought the Ordennans were all about civilization, why would they side with the gknolls, brrrnnh,” but like, at the very least they wouldn’t march into the woods to find her, with swords and torches, right?
 
ALI (overlapping with Austin): Right.
 
KEITH (overlapping with Austin): Yeah. Yeah.
 
AUSTIN: Um—
 
KEITH: Could I fr—maybe I could [laughing] frame the Ordennans. No.
 
AUSTIN (doubtful): Mmm.
 
KEITH: Hmm. Umm…
 
AUSTIN: There are people in mills. [laughs a bit] Janine in the chat says—
 
JANINE: “Shocking no one, I might have a plan here.”
 
AUSTIN: What is you plan?
 
KEITH: What’s that, what’s your plan?

JANINE: So when is she being executed?
 
AUSTIN: At the end of the next turn.
 
JANINE: So not the end of this current turn.
 
AUSTIN: Correct.
 
KEITH: No.
 
JANINE: Um… [sighs] There was a thing I was intending to do with Sol… And it didn’t really have an endgame.
 
AUSTIN: Uh-huh?
 
JANINE: Um… Sh—I don’t—
 
ALI: We’re doing that and then going to the newspaper, is getting the newspaper involved gonna do…
 
AUSTIN (overlapping): The news—
 
JANINE: I was thinking of not going to the newspaper.
 
ALI: Okay.
 
AUSTIN: The newspaper can—
 
JANINE: And instead going to the Major Crime Division.
 
AUSTIN: So yeah. Like, Major Crimes Division can do stuff here. The way to think about Major Crimes Division and the newspaper: Major Crime Division can interfere with stuff immediately, the newspaper stuff will have long-term effects in Rosemerrow.
 
JANINE (overlapping with Austin): Exactly.
 
ALI: Okay.
 
JANINE: Yeah, I—so my intention was basically to—to go to Sol and then instead of going to the newspaper as I’d originally planned, go to… Major Crimes, cause you know there’re several people here that we would like to get clemency, and…
 
AUSTIN: Mhmm. [pause] I’m gonna tell you—
 
JANINE (overlapping): It’s dependent on some other stuff, but, that’s not off the table.
 
AUSTIN: Right now, you can’t get clemency—you can’t get clemency for everybody, is a thing that I’m gonna tell you right now.
 
JANINE: Hmm.
 
KEITH: Um—
 
AUSTIN: There is going to be a limit, no matter what you roll, that is—that—for what Major Crimes—Major Crimes can’t—doesn’t have—Major Crimes basically has the authority to go get a few suspects of their own and hold them.
 
JANINE (overlapping): Mhm. 
 
AUSTIN: But not to… Like, say “Okay no one gets to kill anybody.” [sort of laughs]
 
KEITH: Does anybody think they know where Lutz is?
 
ALI: Arrel did, and he left.
 
AUSTIN: Yeah—well he’s in one of those bubbles, like—
 
ALI (overlapping): Right.
 
JANINE: Yeah, what?
 
KEITH: Like—
 
JACK: Yeah, like unless we can work out how in two turns somehow to pull someone from a bubble…
 
ALI (overlapping with Jack): Yeah. 
 
ALI: We should probably ask that guy.
 
JANINE: I wasn’t gonna pull someone from a bubble, I was gonna talk to the dude who has arranged to be put in a bubble but has not yet been put in a bubble.
 
AUSTIN (overlapping with Ali): Mhmm.
 
ALI (overlapping with Austin): Right.
 
JACK: Yeah. Hmm.
 
ALI: Oh he can tell—hmmmm.
 
JANINE: Sol was not arranging for transportation out of [laughing] town.
 
ALI: Yeah.
 
JACK: No.
 
AUSTIN: Okay. Fero, did you have another question? Did we ask the questions? Are we good? 
 
KEITH: Umm. Yeah I guess gknolls seem to have a better understanding of what’s going on anyway. Maybe I can ask them what… Hmm. I wonder what Mother Glory knows about the Heat and the Dark.
 
AUSTIN: That’s a good question. Um. She… has heard that term before. And, has… She—the kind of like, clan knowledge base, does not believe that the Erasure is the Heat and the Dark.
 
KEITH: Okay.
 
AUSTIN: But the Erasure was… like, the folly of men, basically. But that it wasn’t the Heat and the Dark. Like there’s—she thinks that the was… And is now, not a thing worth caring about. 
 
KEITH: The Erasure, or the Heat and the Dark?

AUSTIN: Either, really. Right like the Erasure is a place on the map you can’t go. Don’t go there!

KEITH: Mhmm.
 
AUSTIN (slipping into character as Mother Glory): There’s enough map for us to deal with elsewhere. The Heat and the Dark, if it is real, won’t arrive for a long time. And until then my people are suffering. What do I care if they—if—if you can extend the life of Hieron by another century or two? If right now I have people starving and being stabbed to death. If someone else wishes to prioritize in thate way, I’m not going to stop them. But understand that that priority is coming from a place of—of ease. That their life is easier. I’m slipping into Red Jack voice which is a little bit lower. [sort of laughs]
 
AUSTIN: So yeah, she just doesn’t—kind of sees caring about the Heat and the Dark as being kind of a thing that you… It’s a luxury. When like, her people aren’t allowed to farm. You know? [pause] Okay. Okay. Lem. You find Emmanuel. He is… Um. So, two things to note. One, there are not many bodies [kind of laughing] left behind in the canyon. In the part of the canyon that the star fell in. Two, the ones that are there, are not undead.
 
JACK: They’re just dead?

AUSTIN: They’re just dead.
 
JACK: [long breath] Okay. Is this weird for Emmanuel?
 
AUSTIN: Yes.
 
JACK: Cause I feel like—he’s had pretty much an entire—like longer than an entire life to come to terms with undeath, and to see it taken away like this…
 
AUSTIN: It’s very strange. Um… 
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): Lem, I’m so glad. You came back.
 
JACK (as Lem): I’m sorry we had to… You know. Leave so quickly.
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel, overlapping some): No. There was a living star. It fell and… [sort of laughs] I’ve never seen anything like that. Not even the cannons, were like that.
 
JACK (as Lem): You saw we killed it, right?
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): Hella… Is there anything she will not kill? An empress, a prince?
 
JACK (as Lem): You know, I don’t think… I don’t think there is. She tried to—she successfully killed… Like, geology today. [Austin/Emmanuel sort of laughs] That’s kind of impressive I guess. Um… 
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): I wonder if I will ever be as good at anything as Hella is at killing. 
 
ALI: [laughs] Nope.
 
[everyone laughs]
 
AUSTIN: Damn, girl!
 
ALI: [laughs] No, he makes a great crepe, I’m sorry.
 
JACK (as Lem): I mean you make a good crepe, honestly. Um. Look, ah… I’ve found something. Uh… Could we go somewhere and—and uh…
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel, overlapping): Yeah.
 
JACK (as Lem): Have you heard of the… the Cult of the Dark Sun?
 
AUSTIN: He gives you like, a very… serious look.
 
JACK (as Lem): I—
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): Do not get mixed up with them, Lem. [laughs]
 
JACK (as Lem, overlapping): Alright, I’ve got—
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): I—I—I told you once to listen to my advice and you did not. And now… You walk with a curse. I tell you now, do not get mixed up with them. I have heard things. What they do.
 
JACK (as Lem): Okay, so… This is your opportunity, Emmanuel. To um… You can walk away, now. I’m giving you an opportunity this time. Uh. Didn’t go so well last time, but this is—[Austin sort of laughs] this is your opportunity here.
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel, overlapping): Ah—wh—mmm.
 
JACK (as Lem): I can’t tell you any more than this. I just need you to make a decision now, please.
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): Wheuuu—your memory, sometimes, Lem. I gave you an opportunity to leave. [Ali giggles] And you looked into my eyes, and you said you would not. 
 
JACK (as Lem, overlapping): No, look—I—no, look, Emmanuel—no look, Emmanuel—
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): And we shared a cigarette on the balcony, and then you were gone and I thought I would never see you again. And now you’re telling me I could walk out. I can’t walk out.
 
JACK (as Lem): Okay. This means that you can’t be like directly cross with me, right? This means you can be sort of tangentially cross with me? [Janine laughs] Um… Uh… Because... So I’ve killed at least one member of the Dark Sun and I’ve stolen something fr—
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel, distressed): Ohhhhhhhh.
 
[Janine laughs]

JACK (as Lem): No, it gets worse, please, no, save that sound, please save that sound. [distressed sounds continues] No, it’s gonna get worse. I’ve stolen something from them. 
 
[Austin/Emmanuel makes vague distressed sound again]
 
[Dre laughs]
 
JACK (as Lem): Yeah you see this is why [laughing] I said to wait.
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): My life—Lem, you need to understand. I was doing a tour of duty on the Kingdom Come, I… I was going to come home and with the money I received open a bakery. And then on the horizon, there was a boat. And you were on that boat, and my life [snorts] has been so complicated, ever since.
 
JACK (as Lem): Everybody’s life has been—well, yeah, okay. I’m sorry. 
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): Why did—[sighs] What did you take?
 
JACK (as Lem): This is the worst bit. Um. I think it’s—I think it’s some kind of… I think it’s some kind of cursed… sword hilt… that… I think it’s like a cursed sword hilt that is related to a sort of… Like there was this horrifying ball of darkness. And there was this thing. And—look, look. Look, Emmanuel. I’ve been—I’m supposed to be a detective. 

AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): You?

JACK (as Lem): Right, well. Thank you.
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): Are you as good of a detective as a lawyer?
 
JACK (as Lem): Ah, well, ah—so here’s the thing.
 
AUSTIN: Like, smirks.
 
JACK (as Lem): I’m—as far as I can tell being a detective is mostly about, um, collecting evidence. And, now I’ve got some. Uh… I don’t really know what to do with it so I was wondering if you could take a… Take a look at this, you know to see if it rings any bells?
 
AUSTIN: He like, closes the door to the cafe and locks it.
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): Lem. You came to a baker, to ask about a cursed sword hilt.
 
JACK (as Lem): Well, you’re a ghost. [Janine laughs in background] And I like you very much.
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): You—[pause] If you wanna spend time with me, you just, come see me.
 
JACK (as Lem, softly): Yeah. C—can you also please check out this cursed sword?
 
[everyone laughs loudly]
 
AUSTIN (amused and baffled): I—he doesn’t have anything to say about this cursed sword, wh—?
 
[Ali laughs]
 
JACK: No Austin, he absolutely has something to say about this cursed sword—
 
AUSTIN (overlapping): No, he—! I don’t think he’s—
 
JACK: Even if it’s like, [laughing] “What is that? This is really frightening.”
 
AUSTIN: [exhales] And you like unwrap it, I guess it’s in like a cloth. Or I guess did—wait, did you just take—you just took it, right? Yeah. So when you open up your bag you see that that plant is already shriveling, from being near it.
 
JACK (as Lem): Oh Jesus Christ, Emmanuel! [laughs] Do you have some water?
 
[Austin/Emmanuel makes vague confused noises]
 
JACK (as Lem): This belongs to—ah, Christ, um—this bel—ah, don’t worry. Just, ah—okay.
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): Why do you have weed?
 
[pause]
 
JACK (as Lem): Right, well that’s not mine.
 
[Keith and Ali laugh]
 
KEITH: He’s holding it for a friend.
 
JACK (as Lem): That belongs to—[laughs] That belongs to um… You know what don’t worry. 
 
AUSTIN: He like lifts it.
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): It’s… heavy. Ah—
 
JACK (as Lem): Yeah so it’s heavy for you as well, huh?
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): Did you think because I was from Nacre it would be, light, and airy?

JACK (as Lem): Well I’ve never been dead, so uh… You know I couldn’t—couldn’t really…
 
[Austin/Emmanuel sighs]
 
JACK (as Lem): But no, nothing there, huh? No? [pause] Okay. Well. Um. Do you have another bag?
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel, softly): Yes. Let me—let me get you some tea, and a bag, and… I want you to sit. And just… breathe. And we can sit together. And… Just, please. Take some time. Before whatever craziness comes next for you.
 
JACK (as Lem): Yeah, I can do that.
 
AUSTIN (as Emmanuel): Okay.
 
AUSTIN: Take +1 forward on your next roll.
 
JACK: Yesss. I got that boyfriend +1 forward!
 
[everyone laughs]

AUSTIN: Okay. Tone switch. Adaire and Hella. [Ali laughs] Fuckin’. So you find… You find the home of… Sid Cider-Brew.
 
JANINE: Sol. Isn’t it Sol?
 
AUSTIN (overlapping with Janine): I fuckin—it’s Sol. Sid is his cousin.
 
KEITH (overlapping with Austin): Sol Cedar-Brow.
 
JANINE: Yeah.
 
AUSTIN: Sol Cedar-Brow. Sol Sumba-Bumber.
 
JANINE (overlapping): Yeah.
 
AUSTIN: That’s him.
 
JANINE: Spider-man.
 
AUSTIN: Sol Spider-man. 
 
KEITH: Sid Sander-Plant. 
 
AUSTIN: [laughs] Sandy Saddle-Bags. Yep. That’s him.
 
[Janine laughs]
 
ALI (very faintly, overlapping with Austin): God…
 
AUSTIN: Alright, so his house is like… He hasn’t gotten to the point where he gets to make to it look, like, fancy. But he’s gotten to the point where he’s started making purchases for when he gets to the point where it starts to get fancy? So like, his lobby is filled with boxes of—like he has really fancy frames, and nothing to put in them. And they’re just like in crates near the door. Um… And that’s just like where he’s at in his life, I don’t mean that it’s like a thing he did today. Do you know what I mean? Um… Or like he has like—there’s a room in his like estate that is a really ni—it’s like a converted—also, his estate is a converted windmill. He’s like removed the mill and turned it into a multilevel home. There’s a room that’s like a living room, that just doesn’t have any furniture in it but has an amazing carpet but like he just doesn’t have money for the furniture yet. Um… I’m guessing—wait, how did you get in? Did you just like walk in? There’s no one here—there’s no one at the door. And when you knock no one comes in—or no one comes to the door.
 
JANINE: Is it locked?
 
AUSTIN: Yeah.
 
JANINE: No it’s not.
 
AUSTIN: Okay.
 
[Ali snorts loudly]
 
AUSTIN: So that’s how I’m giving you this detail, inside—
 
ALI (overlapping with Austin): Hella locks it when they go in.
 
AUSTIN: Yeah. Good. Um… You find Sol… Cinder-Block, on… The top floor, behind another lock, in his panic room, basically.
 
[Ali laughs sympathetically]
 
[Janine laughs]
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Oh boy oh boy. Oh boy. Oh boy. [singsong] Da da da da da da da da, [Janine laughing in background] Rosemerrow oh Rosemerrow, [dissolves into vague syllables, still singing] …our bread… da da da da… wind up dead… Rosemerrow Rosemerroooow… It’s home.
 
AUSTIN: [sort of laughs] Does someone like knock on the door? Kick it in? 
 
ALI (overlapping): Yeah.
 
AUSTIN: Like what’s your—what’s your—
 
JANINE: Just, we’re gonna knock, we’ll knock each door, and then if each door does not get answered then we… do the things that get us past the door.
 
AUSTIN (overlapping with Janine): What sorta knock do you do?
 
ALI (vaguely in character as Hella): Gonna take us a long time Adaire, but it’s fine.
 
JANINE (vaguely as Adaire): I have a very musical knock. It’s got—got rhythm, it’s charming. [laughs a bit]
 
KEITH: Can I get an example?
 
JANINE: Spritely.
 
AUSTIN: Yeah, what sort of—what sort of—[knocks once, pause, two more times] Like that? Or like…
 
JANINE: Yeah yeah yeah. You know.
 
KEITH: Is it just shave and a haircut?

 
JANINE: What? 
 
AUSTIN: [to “shave and a haircut” tune] Shave and a haircut, [knocks twice in rythm] two cents.
 
DRE (at same time as Austin): [to “shave and a haircut” tune] Bum ba da bum bum, bum bum.
 
JANINE: I mean it’s in that vein, it’s probably not the same as that, it’s—yeah.
 
AUSTIN (overlapping with Janine): Okay. Yeah.
 
AUSTIN: That’s also from “Oh Rosemerrow.” The musical. [Ali and Janine laugh] He goes,
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): That doesn’t sound like Arrell. 

JANINE (as Adaire, mocking): No, I bet it doesn’t. 
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Oh, no.
 
ALI (as Hella): Hiii. 
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Hey buddy.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): No. The door is lo—I’m changing. You can’t come in right now.
 
[Dre laughs]
 
JANINE (as Adaire): All your—your closet stuff’s out here. 
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Wh—uh, I have extra. 
 
JANINE (as Adaire, overlapping): What are you changing into?
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): I have more clothes. My fancy ones.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): [laughs] Oh you have a secret underwear room, okay.
 
[Ali laughs a bit]
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): It’s not—it’s a suit, I’m putting on a nice suit cause I’m going somewhere very nice.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): You going on a date?

  AUSTIN (as Sol): Not so much.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): No?
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Auhhh…
 
ALI (as Hella): Just open the door.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Why don’t we talk? Why don’t—
 
AUSTIN: You hear—[laughs]
 
JANINE (as Adaire, overlapping with Austin): Why don’t you come and we have a little talk? My friend?
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, overlapping with Janine/Adaire): Give me two—alright, give me two seconds, I’ll be right out.
 
KEITH (overlapping with Janine): Don’t believe this fucker.
 
JANINE: You didn’t make us roll, Austin, do you want us to…
 
AUSTIN: No. I’m not gonna make you roll. 
 
JANINE: Okay. Alright.
 
AUSTIN: You just—this isn’t—you just narrate shit.
 
JANINE (overlapping): Sounds good. 
 
AUSTIN: Unless you’re doing a move, in which case you’ll roll.
 
JANINE: No. Not yet.
 
ALI: Roll… coming to the place.
 
AUSTIN: Oh, that roll. I see.
 
JANINE (overlapping): Yeah.
 
AUSTIN: Yes yes yes yes yes. Give me that roll.
 
JANINE: Okay.
 
AUSTIN: My bad.
 
JANINE: Uhhhh. I think that’s 2d6 plus 3 because Hella still has a +1 from her delicious, delicious snack, that she got.
 
[Ali laughs]
 
AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah, it’s three. True. True.
 
ALI (quietly): Uh-huh.
 
AUSTIN: Boom. Fourteen.
 
ALI: Ooh!
 
JANINE: Alright.
 
AUSTIN: Damn good. If that was an attack roll you could remove something from him [laughing] Hella.
 
[Ali and Janine laugh]
 
AUSTIN: You hear him trying to push furniture in front of the door.
 
ALI (very faintly, pitying): Oohh… Sweet…
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Oh I’m just stuck, I’ll be right out. Hah.
 
AUSTIN: And then like, slam as the bookshelf falls in front of the door. On his side.
 
[Janine/Adaire gives a long sigh]
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): I should’ve put in windows, why are there no windows in here?!
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Well that defeats the purpose of the panic room, you idiot.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, overlapping): Augh.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Because then people can get in through the windows.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Thank you, that’s—you’re right, this was a smart play on my part, now that you lay it out like that.
 
ALI (as Hella): Adaire, am I breaking this door or not?
 
JANINE (as Adaire): I—I mean I didn’t wanna break his shit but if he’s gonna make us break his shit then you should probably break his shit.
 
ALI (as Hella, overlapping with Janine/Adaire): He’s making us break his shit!
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): No it’s fine, break it—I—don’t break it though, please.

ALI (as Hella): Are you gonna open the door? [laughs]
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, overlapping with Ali/Hella): Just—I—what do you—
 
JANINE (as Adaire, overlapping with Ali/Hella): Do you want us to break it or not, Sol?
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): I guess I’m just saying it doesn’t really matter to me cause I’ll be [somewhat singsong] gone soon.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): No you won’t. Do you want us to break your shit or not, Sol?
 
ALI (as Hella, overlapping with Janine/Adaire): Yeah.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, overlapping with Janine/Adaire): Wh—w—what do you mean—okay. Don’t break my shit.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Then [laughing] come out.
 
ALI (as Hella, overlapping with Janine/Adaire, laughing): Okay, then open the door. 
 
[Dre laughs]
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): You open the door.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): That’s how—that’s how the shit gets broken, Sol.
 
[Ali snd Keith laugh]
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, overlapping with Janine/Adaire): What do we need—I don’t know that we need to see—
 
JANINE (as Adaire): This is the conversation we’re having.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): I feel like we could just have this conversation like this. I can hear you pretty fine. Frankly.
 
ALI (as Hella, overlapping): Mm-mm.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): I can’t hear you at all.
 
ALI (as Hella): Yeah. What’d you say?
 
JANINE (as Adaire): I haven’t heard a thing you’ve said.
 
[Ali laughs quietly]
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): That Adaire is a real piece of work, am I right? Am I right, eh?
 
JANINE (as Adaire, overlapping with Austin/Sol): It’s very difficult.
 
[pause]
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Alright, she can’t hear me. 
 
ALI (as Hella, overlapping with Austin/Sol): A little bit. Just come out. [laughs]
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): N—no. N—I will not.
 
ALI: I break the door. [sort of laughs]
 
AUSTIN: A crossbow bolt flies at you.
 
ALI: Oh!
 
AUSTIN: Give me a Defy Danger.
 
ALI: Sure.
 
AUSTIN: Or just take a hit and then we’ll heal it. It’s up to you.
 
ALI (laughing): Yeah.
 
JANINE: Does it—wait, does it—I—
 
ALI (overlapping with Janine): I—I like—
 
JANINE: I—I have Shoot First, does that count for Shoot First?
 
AUSTIN: What’s that do?
 
JANINE: “You’re never caught by surprise. When an enemy would get the drop on you, you get to act first instead.”
 
AUSTIN: Yeah. I’ll give it to you. What do you do?
 
JANINE: So, in this situation he is trying to get the drop on us by…
 
AUSTIN: Shooting Hella in the chest with a crossbow.
 
JANINE: With a crossbow. Um… I’m gonna whip his pocket watch in his face.
 
AUSTIN: [snorts] Okay. It—
 
JANINE: Like hard.
 
AUSTIN: It—you just do it. It slaps him in the face, and he pulls up and shoots, and it hits the ceiling. Um… You can see—like you get a look at him now and he’s been beat to shit. He’s like all bruised up, and is like—his leg is in a cast, and… He’s missing a few teeth.
 
JANINE: Well he greets people like this, what do you expect?
 
ALI (as Hella): Adaire, someone beat me to it.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Okay.
 
[Ali laughs]
 
JANINE (as Adaire, overlapping with Austin/Sol): Listen. Listen, we’re not here—okay. Honestly, if you just—if you had just met us in the living room with tea, this—none of this would have—
 
AUSTIN (overlapping with Janine): He’s like—
 
JANINE (as Adaire): I don’t wanna rough you up.
 
AUSTIN: He’s putting the crossbow down but like while he’s doing it he’s loading another bolt into the crossbow? [Ali laughs] Like but he’s doing it in that like slooow like “I’m not doing anything wrong right now I’m just loading another bolt in the crossbow” [laughing] and like.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Sol, we can see you.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, defeated): Okay.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): You’re not even like hiding behind furniture doing that like you’re just standing there like a cow in a field—okay.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, overlapping with Janine/Adaire): Mm—okay. Okay, I’m putting it down, I’m putting it down, I’m putting down the crossbow.
 
ALI (as Hella): You’ve seen me fight. 
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Yeah, you’re right.
 
AUSTIN: Puts it down.
 
ALI (as Hella, overlapping with Austin): Let’s just talk.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): What do you need?
 
JANINE (as Adaire): We’re just here to talk.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Okay. What do you—what—oh. [pause] Can you—
 
JANINE (as Adaire): I mean actually I’m here for a little more than talking, but mostly—
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Oh, then I’ll pick up the crossbow again if that’s the case! 
 
[Ali and Janine laugh]
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Uh… Look. I’m actually here—I thought… This is good news cause you’re really fu—you’re scared, for reasons, that I—I don’t know why you’re—But… I’m here to take you to protective custody, Sol.
 
JANINE: I’m gonna flash my badge.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, overlapping with Janine): I don’t—I don’t need any protection, actually. I’m protected right here in—
 
JANINE (as Adaire, overlapping): You’re hiding in a panic room.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): A panic room. 
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Someone’s clearly all—roughed you all up.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): I… Well that was—
 
JANINE (as Adaire): You seem very—you seem very scared to me and as your friend—as your friend, Sol—
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Okay, well now I know I can’t trust you. If—
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Your friend and your business partner.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Well we broke that arrangement. The trees—

 JANINE (as Adaire): Did we? We did I guess, d—you did.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): I did. I got a better offer and it has paid off, well. Sure I got—
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Doesn’t look like it.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Well you gotta take a few lumps. That’s what they always say. It takes a few lumps to make a good cup of coffee. It’s sugar in that case, though.
 
ALI (as Hella): We can be very sweet.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): That is a threat.
 
[Ali laughs]
 
[Janine laughs]
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): The thing you just did, I—I know a threat.
 
ALI (as Hella): It sounded like—I’m sorry, I just—I sound like that. Really what’s going on is, there’s a lot of things at work here, Sol.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Uh-huh. I know. [Ali laughs] Believe me. And I’m getting ready to hit the old trail. 
 
JANINE (as Adaire, overlapping): Yeah. You sure are, aren’t you?
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): You know Rosemerrow’s great while it’s been here but I… Finding new prospects over the horizon.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Mhmm. You pissed your cousin off quite a lot there, didn’t you? 

AUSTIN (as Sol, dismissive): Ehhh…
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Moving that shit around for that—that wizard guy. 
 
[Austin/Sol groans]
 
ALI (as Hella, overlapping with Janine/Adaire): Yeah he’s—he’s having a rough time.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Instead of doing the work that he uh…
 
ALI (as Hella): I saw him, he was really depressed. 
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): He’ll getgot better.
 
ALI (as Hella): I hope so.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Will he?
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): He’s on the list, just further down!
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Uh-huh.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Hopefully.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): So you know the list? You’re familiar with it.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, overlapping some): Three hundred, four hundred, fi—somewhere in there. Couple thousand? 
 
JANINE (as Adaire): That’s pretty far down.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): There’s a lot of people in Rosemerrow.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): You’re pretty high on that list, aren’t you?
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): I’m a good businessman. Good businessman. Hm?
 
JANINE (as Adaire): It’s a shame you’re not a better businessman, cause then you might’ve been on the top and we wouldn’t be having this conversation.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): I tried my best, but uh… I think I went up from like, 2508, up to 3 or 4 or 5 or wherever it is. That’s a pretty good move. I did alright for myself.
 
ALI (as Hella): Uh-huh.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): He’s gonna be here soon, you know.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): You’re not gonna be here, though.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): What are you gonna do to me? 
 
JANINE (as Adaire): We’re going somewhere.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, overlapping): No.
 
ALI (as Hella): Adaire, that might not work.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Mm-mm.
 
ALI (as Hella): He got that guy outta jail.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Yeah, while I—[scoffs] You ain’t dealing with just a—like a fancy stage magician. This guy’s like different than you andor me. He’s like the only one called “the Wizard.” Like no one else has that name. And like it’s not cause other people couldn’t try to use it, you see? But look, I—I know I did wrong by you and… Twinbrook. You have any questions, I’ll answer your questions.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): You know I think this has all gotten a little bit… tense. And, I really do, Sol, I really do just wanna have… A conversation, I wanna sort a little bit of this out… And then, you know, we’ll be on our way and everything will be fine. Um… I understand you’re also—you know, you’re really stressed right now, so I don’t want you—you feel safe and you need a little room and that’s okay, I’m not gonna bug you there. Um… Do you have like a kettle, and then like, some tea or something? I’ll go make some tea, and then like, you and Hella can have a minute, and I’ll go… Make some tea?
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Adaire. Come on.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): What?
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Come ooon.
 
JANINE (as Adaire, overlapping): I like tea.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Come oooon.
 
JANINE (as Adaire, overlapping): I like tea! It’s good stuff.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): I will—mmm, ah—
 
AUSTIN: You—give me a Defy Danger charisma.
 
ALI: [laughs] What’s the plan here?
 
AUSTIN: She’s gonna poison him, what?
 
ALI: Oh…
 
[Janine laughs]
 
AUSTIN: He wasn’t born yesterday.
 
ALI: I—no, no.
 
JANINE: No?
 
AUSTIN (overlapping with Janine): Not to death. Not to death. She’s gonna knock him out, she’s gonna try to knock him out.
 
JANINE: I have a sleep poison, that’s the whole—yeah. To knock him out and then we haul him off.
 
JACK (overlapping with Janine): I mean, couldn’t Hella just—couldn’t Hella just, knock him out?
 
DRE: Punch him. Or Hella can hold him and you could just poor it in his face.
 
[Ali laughs]
 
AUSTIN: Jesus Christ.
 
[Janine laughs]
 
JACK: I’m just saying they’ve got options here.
 
JANINE (overlapping): I like using finesse before I use the—
 
AUSTIN: Oh actually, how many of those do you have left? Did you like use it?
 
JANINE: I have two.
 
AUSTIN: Okay.
 
JANINE: I’ve used one.
 
AUSTIN: Okay.
 
JANINE: I have two left.
 
AUSTIN (overlapping with Ali): Alright.
 
ALI: So—cause my idea’s to—if we like have him… Corroborate what we’re about to tell the cops then we can get people off with that information maybe? But that—
 
JANINE: That’s—
 
ALI (overlapping): He would need—
 
JANINE: The intention is to—like if you show up at the police office—like the police station, just saying like “There’s pocket dimensions, the guy’s fine!” that’s probably not gonna work. If you have a dude who’s also on that list, that maybe… Does more for you.
 
ALI: Right, that’s what I’m saying. But we would need him to be like awake to be able to say like, “Yeah I paid this guy to do this…”
 
JANINE (overlapping): We can wake him up. It puts him into a light sleep, is what the description of the poison says.
 
ALI: Okay, but we could just convince him to do that, like [laughing] don’t poison him.
 
JANINE: I don’t know that we’re getting anywhere with that. [overlapping with Keith] You know?
 
KEITH: Yeah, might as well have him wake up in the police station, right?
 
AUSTIN (overlapping with Dre): I’ll let them—I...
 
DRE: I mean… Your question could be, “What will it take to get Sol to testify?”
 
AUSTIN: Totally. Totally could be that.
 
ALI: Yeah.

AUSTIN: Um, I think… Y—I—do this however you want, I think this is a good plan that I’m gonna let happen. But it’s like… Either poison him, or not him, tell me which for color and character, but like…
 
ALI: Okay.
 
AUSTIN: You won’t get any more information if you knock him out right now though. [sort of laughs]
 
JANINE: Well that was kind of the intention of doing the poison thing was that Hella still had time to do her thing.
 
AUSTIN (overlapping): Yeah yeah yeah.
 
JANINE: To find a question or something there.
 
AUSTIN: [sighs] He says like,
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Alright fine I have a kettle, of course I have a kettle. [Ali laughs] I live in Rosemerrow, we love tea.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): I make really good tea, too. I know how—I put it in for the right time and everything.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): I bet.
 
ALI (as Hella): Oh yeah different kind of teas dif—need different times.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Just go make the fuckin tea.
 
[Janine laughs]
 
ALI: Um…
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Your sword looks different.
 
ALI (as Hella): Does it? I mean, I’ve been so busy today.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): What happened to that gem? In the middle?
 
ALI (as Hella): Oh. Uh. That’s weird.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Mmm.
 
ALI (as Hella, softly): Uh.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Anyway. She’s gonna—she’s gonna poison me.
 
ALI (as Hella, faintly): She isn’t gonna, she gets ideas—
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, overlapping): Yes she is, I know how… [groans] 
 
ALI (as Hella): She gets ideas. She’ll… [Janine laughs] It’s fine.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): That’s good, that’s good to get ideas. 
 
ALI (as Hella): Uh-huh.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): I get ideas too. You gotta find the right idea.
 
ALI (as Hella): Yeah. No that’s why I came with her, cause you know she gets carried away.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): She’s… 
 
ALI (as Hella): She’s great.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Bright future. I mean until the whole thing. Til the whole—[kind of laughs] end of the world thing.
 
ALI (as Hella): Mm.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): But until then, bright future.
 
ALI (as Hella): So that was really your plan, you were just gonna…
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Leave?
 
ALI (as Hella): Yeah.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): [pause] Yeah. Yeah. Why wouldn’t I? How—what—you see this house. I ain’t got much. I got a cousin who doesn’t like me. I don’t blame him. I mean—I—mmm. I’m pretty likeable, I blame him a little. [Ali/Hella laughs] Right, I’ve done alright for myself, but… There’s a limit to these things. I’ve said “It’s just business” for as many days as there are in a year in my life. And it turns out, here I am, a grown adult. I look around… And it’s just business, right? That’s all it is. That’s all I got. [Ali/Hella takes a breath] So.
 
ALI (as Hella): Sol, I don’t care if you wanna go. That’s fine. It’s—
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Well then we don’t have a problem! [overlapping with Hella] I—[something else indistinguishable]
 
ALI (as Hella): We don’t really need you around, but before you do—[sort of laughs]
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, overlapping): Oh. Okay.
 
ALI (as Hella, overlapping): There’s a—
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Here’s the ask. 
 
ALI (as Hella): Yeah. There’s some people who wanna stay and help, who… Are gonna get killed. That’s really what we’re here for I guess. I don’t know. I don’t like being a detective. I hate this.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): It’s tough work, I—that’s why I went into business instead. 
 
ALI (as Hella): I have a sword. I have a cool sword.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, overlapping): You’ve got big arms.
 
ALI (as Hella): Yeah, I’ve got the big arms! [laughing] 
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, overlapping): Why don’t you just beat people up?
 
ALI (as Hella): What does that have to do with being a detective?
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): I don’t know!
 
[Ali laughs]
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): You gotta find a better crew. Listen I know some people who do like mercenary-type work. They just go in, they kick down the door, they kill a few people. These days especially the Ordennans, they’re paying like uh… bounties, on these zombie folk.
 
ALI (as Hella, faintly, overlapping): Yeah. I know, I know that they are…
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): It’s great! You get a—and you got a title, I bet they’d pay you extra.
 
ALI (as Hella, faintly): Mm.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Why are you—why do you hang around with these folks?
 
ALI (as Hella): [sighs] It’s…
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): I saw you there, in the—the—the—the forest, in the village. You didn’t understand what was going on. 
 
ALI (as Hella): [sighs] I… Last time I was south I had a… It… A mission went wrong, I would say. I just…
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, overlapping): Yeah. 
 
ALI (as Hella): You wanna go to a different universe, you can do that. I just wanna… Pretend like everything’s normal here while I can.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): That’s stupid [Ali laughs] but, you know. That’s—to each their own.
 
ALI (as Hella): You got a cousin who hates you, I got some friends that—who still like me though. Listen, I…
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, incredulous): Hey rub it in, why don’t you. Okay. [overlapping with Ali/Hella] Okay!
 
ALI (as Hella): Yeah, I’m just saying—[laughs]
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Okay, no it’s fine, give me the tea I guess.
 
ALI (as Hella): I’m gonna spend the time with them that I can.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): [softly] Okay. Yeah, okay. [getting back to normal volume] You know you could have like a cooler sword in the dimension, though. Like whatever sort of sword you—
 
ALI (as Hella, overlapping): I don’t even like this sword. Someone just gave it to me.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): How much—how much do you—wait, where’d you even get that sword? [Ali laughs] Someone gave it to you?
 
ALI (as Hella, laughing): Yeah.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): That’s a nice sword!
 
[Janine laughs]
 
ALI (as Hella): I know.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): How much do you want for that sword?
 
ALI (as Hella): Ugh. Shut up.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): I can’t use it anyway, but I could—I cou—mm. I bet I could make some money in there.
 
ALI (as Hella, overlapping): Listen.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Sword like that. 
 
ALI (as Hella): [laughs softly] Wait.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, overlapping): Where’d you—
 
ALI (as Hella, laughing): You would go into the—
 
JANINE: You’d bring the sword into the pocket dimension.
 
ALI (as Hella): You’d go to another dimension and then just have it still be just business?
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Well that’s what—I… [overlapping with Ali/Hella] I—
 
ALI (as Hella): I guess if that’s all you’re good at.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): I’d be really good at it there. I wouldn’t have any competition. The people would like… Yeahh, they’d get my name right for one, they’d stop called me like, Sol Cinter-Claws or whatever, they’d start calling me by my real name. Sol Cider-Brew. With a hyphen, between Cider and Brew.
 
KEITH: Sid Sodder-Brow.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): That’s not my name.
 
[Ali laughs]
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): It’s not. I don’t know why—[breathes in] I don’t know why peop—
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Listen. I always—
 
JANINE: I’m back with the tea.
 
AUSTIN: Okay.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): I always call people by the names they ask me to call them by, even the dude who wants me to call him “the Lardwolf,” I still do it.
 
AUSTIN (overlapping, ambiguously in-character): [laughs loudly] That’s true, you do! 
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Okay?
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): You do do that! That guys a piece of work. Uh…
 
JANINE (as Adaire): He’s nice!
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Yeah. Anyway—
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Here’s your tea. Hella I brought you some crackers.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): Great.
 
ALI (as Hella, overlapping with Austin/Sol): Oh thanks.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): No you’re not—don’t drink the tea, Hella.
 
ALI (as Hella): Ah—she—
 
JANINE: No, the tea—I gave—I—the tea is for Sol, the crackers are for Hella.
 
AUSTIN (overlapping, as Sol): Oh. I don’t think—
 
ALI (ambiguously in-character): Also there’s other hot water like she could just make me good tea. [laughs]
 
AUSTIN (as Sol): I can’t get crackers? You’re gonna knock me out and you’re not gonna give me crackers.
 
JANINE (as Adaire): Okay. You can split the crackers. I thought the crackers would make your mouth dry when you woke up, especially with the tea, like you know.
 
AUSTIN (as Sol, overlapping with Janine/Adaire): Thank you. Mmm, okay.
